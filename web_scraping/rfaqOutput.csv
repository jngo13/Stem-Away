What am I doing wrong?
Neither Mode() nor the solution in hints, stats.mode(), is working.
I found a solution on ProgrammingR
getMode <- function(x) {
keys <- na.omit(unique(x))
keys[which.max(tabulate(match(x, keys)))]
}

that is working quite well, but I assume that this is not the solution meant by the tutorial…
Can anybody help?

Jup, I had the same issue… and after clicking view solution it just gave me the same Mode() solution I used before…
At now I can continue with the course.

Same issue. I have made a Bug Report.

Same issue here! Reporting as well.
And @maiabali, thanks for the help!

Same issue as well! I just reported it!

The lesson part introduces the function Mode() from the DescTools library. It produces a result, but is not accepted. The hint suggests the untaught function stats.mode(). Using it produces an error, function not found. The solution, as other people have said, is identical to the not accepted at first use of Mode().

Had the same problem! Couldn’t find a difference so I copied the given solution, reset the question, and replaced the given code with the solution code, and it didn’t work! Felt like I was going crazy for a while

Same issue here. Exercice seems to be broken. Reporting it !

This issue is still present. A shame. Reporting.
A hint to anyone affected: just press “View the Solution” and move forward.

Hi everyone,
I have a short question about the pattern parameter in the list.files() function.
In this lesson, to assing the list of files, one needs to type
student_files <- list.files(pattern = 'exams_.*csv')

Usually, I would assume that * would be the wildcard symbol, so that
student_files <- list.files(pattern = 'exams_*.csv')

would make more sense to me. Googling about wildcard characters for the pattern parameter in list.files() didn’t quite help me.
So why is it that the upper line of code works with the files exams_0.csv, exams_1.csv, …, exams_9.csv, while the line of code which makes more sense to me doesn’t?
Thanks,
Fready




 chip8582749942:

list.files


I asked myself the exact same question and did not find an answer either.

I found it out by myself by now.
The string for the pattern parameter is a so called regular expression (regex).
A regex can contain stuff like ‘\d’, which would stand for any digit from 0-9.
The dot . is indeed the wildcard symbol, and an asterisk followed by either a character or an expression means that this expression can be repeated arbitrarily many times, even 0 times.
For an actual dot, one has to put a backslash before the dot.
For example, the regex pattern ‘a(ha)*’ would match the string ‘aha’, but also the strings ‘ahahahahahaha’ and ‘a’.
The pattern ‘exams_.*csv’ thus means: Find any filename that contains the substrings ‘exams_’ and, somewhere after that, ‘csv’.
The string ‘yo_mama_so_stupid_she_failed_all_exams_twice_42_csv’ would match the pattern as well, and it doesn’t even contain a dot.
Instead of *, one can also use +, which would mean an arbitrary number of repetitions, but at least one occurence. Thus the pattern ‘a(ha)+’ would not match ‘a’ anymore, but still ‘aha’ and ‘ahahahahahaha’.
As I mentioned before, \d inside a pattern string stands for any digit, so
student_files <- list.files(pattern = 'exams_\d+\.csv')

This means: Find any filenames that contain the substring ‘exams_’, directly followed by one or more digits (given through \d+), directly followed by the substring ‘.csv’ (remember the backslash before the dot). However, the filename ‘bexams_000.csvvv’ will most likely also match this pattern, since regular expressions need extra specifications to require that a string begins or ends with a certain expression.
I refer to the following links:
https://www.regular-expressions.info/
https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter7/
I’ve read the latter one today, this is why I know about this now, and could give myself an answer. It’s a bit annoying that no one else answered us in (more than) a week…
Cheers!

I am almost wondering if this is a typo on CodeAcademy. Because if you look on say, StackOverflow, it appears the * wildcard functions like it does in other languages where it expects characters to be in that position.
Wish @codeacademy would offer clarity.

Thanks for this helpful reply, I wondered the same thing myself.

I am interested in knowing the difference between loading the whole entire data frame and inspecting the first couple of columns by using the head() function.

stud,
You don’t load the head of the data frame, you only view it.  That is, the head is the first six rows of the data frame (by default).  If there are fewer than six rows, you only view those rows.
You load the entire data frame, then view the head.
In more detail: The head displays all of the columns of the first six rows.  If you would like to view more rows with the head() function, you simply put the number of rows you want to view in the head() function, like this – head(df, 10) for the first ten rows.  You can optionally view the tail with the command using analogous syntax.

flip the order of round_up and round_down.

When using ceiling() and floor() on the numeric value 3.14, why does the ceiling() function round up the value to 4?

I tried printing both values in one line by writing the following:
print (round_down, round_up)
Only got the first value printed. When I printed the values separately, both worked fine. What is the problem with printing multiple values at once?

Hello, @dzham. Welcome to the forum.



 dzham:

What is the problem with printing multiple values at once?


Every language has it’s nuances. There are several ways to do what you suggest, but from what I can tell, using paste() seems to be the easiest for what you’ve attempted.
For example:
print(paste(""Value One:"", variable_one, ""Value Two:"", variable_two))

I’ve only dabbled in R a little bit so far myself, so you may find a better answer elsewhere. Happy coding!

ndag,
Just as the ceiling is at the top of a room (4) and the floor is at the bottom (3) for something in the middle (3.14), the functions round accordingly to the whole number above or below.

Just a quick question to check my understanding of mutate().
The following code snippet is provided in the example:
df %>%
  mutate(sales_tax = price * 0.075)

The example then continues: “Now the inventory table has a column called sales_tax , where the value is 0.075 * price:”
Is this statement totally true? I.e., is this modifying the inventory table in place, so to speak, or is mutate() actually returning a new data frame?
This would explain why we need
dogs <- dogs %>%
	mutate()

rather than
dogs %>%
	mutate()

which seems to be implied above.

the first ‘dogs’ is your variable name for the df.

dogs <- dogs %>%

You’re actually overwriting your existing dataframe ‘dogs’ with one that is the same as the existing + the avg_height column.

Is there a reason you need to state the variable/data frame twice though? I thought usually you could do it without having to call it first in other languages - you just redefine it with whatever you’re overwriting it with. (I don’t know if I’m saying this right sorry!)

I’m just wondering why I can’t pipe a dataframe into a function at the same time as assigning the output to a new variable. Or at least, that’s what I’m trying to do, but maybe that’s not what I’m actually doing.
Example:
artists %>%
rock_groups <- filter(genre == ‘Rock’)
The above doesn’t work, and instead I have to write:
rock_groups <- filter(artists, genre == ‘Rock’)
Can anyone explain why I’m not allowed to do the first, and maybe show me how to use piping correctly to assign the output to a variable?




 bradyk:

pipe a dataframe into a function at the same time as assigning the output to a new variable.


It can be done like this:
rock_groups <- artists %>% filter(genre == 'Rock')

The artists data frame is piped into the filter function [this is equivalent to filter(artists, genre == ‘Rock’)], and the output is then assigned to the variable rock_groups.
The problems with
artists %>%
rock_groups <- filter(genre == ‘Rock’)

are:


artists %>% rock_groups is trying to pipe a data frame into a variable. That isn’t correct.


rock_groups <- filter(genre == ‘Rock’) is trying to call the filter function with a condition but no data frame. Then it is trying to assign the result? into a variable.

I just have a simple question about the use of the not operator in R. In the example, we are given the following snippet:
 orders %>%
filter(!(shoe_color == red)) 
Why wouldn’t we just use:
 orders %>%
filter(shoe_color != red)  
Thanks for the help

How do I implement an filter to check:
A | (B & C)


why is it
orders %>%
filter(!(shoe_color == red))
and not
orders %>%
filter(!(shoe_color == “red”))
since red is not a number…?

You are correct. There is a typo in the code snippet. It should be ‘red’ instead of red.

So this arranges the data in a new dataframe… how do I arrange the data in the original dataframe?

Hi,
I use arrange(desc) for both the tasks in this, but the first one asks for ascending order, not descending. What is the code for ascending order?

Hello, @elisea2967290632. Welcome to the forum!
Ascending:
sorted_df_ascending <- arrange(df, column_name)
#or using pipe
sorted_df_ascending <- df %>% arrange(column_name) 

Descending:
sorted_df_descending <- arrange(df, desc(column_name))
#or using pipe
sorted_df_descending <- df %>% arrange(desc(column_name))


artists <- arrange(artists, group)

To arrange data in the original dataframe, you need to update the dataframe.  Is this what you are asking about?

In all the lessons after the introduction to pipping I have not been able to pipe in an argument. In this example I wanted to write:
artists %>%
arrange(group)
group_asc <- arrange(group)
group_asc
to pipe in artists into the arrange function. But I am received with: Error in arrange(group) : object ‘group’ not found
I end up just giving up and not doing the pipping so my result looks like:
arrange(artists, group)
group_asc <- arrange(artists, group)
group_asc
This will allow me to move on, but I am not sure why the pipping isn’t working. I would like to know how because in all the lessons they use it as examples.

Let’s first look at the code snipped which worked for you:
arrange(artists, group)
group_asc <- arrange(artists, group)
group_asc

In this snippet, the first statement [arrange(artists, group)] by itself doesn’t help us in completing our task. The arrange function returns a new data frame (it doesn’t change the existing data frame artists). So the first statement [arrange(artists, group)] takes the data frame artists, sorts it by the group column in ascending order and then throws away the result without saving this resulting sorted data frame. If you delete this first line and write the code as
group_asc <- arrange(artists, group)
group_asc

you will see that this works, because in the statement [group_asc <- arrange(artists, group)], you are assigning the returned sorted data frame to the variable group_asc.

Now let’s look at how you attempted to do the same sorting via piping.
artists %>% arrange(group)
group_asc <- arrange(group)
group_asc

Again the first statement [artists %>% arrange(group)] is useless by itself and should be deleted. This first statement does correctly pipe the artists data frame to the arrange function BUT like before, the resulting sorted data frame is just thrown away without being saved. The second statement generates the error you see [ Error in arrange(group) : object ‘group’ not found]. In this statement i.e. [group_asc <- arrange(group)], you call the arrange function without any data frame but just a column name. The compiler thinks group is the data frame and when it sees that there is no data frame called group, it raises the error.

The correct way to do the piping and then view the result would be:
group_asc <- artists %>% arrange(group)
group_asc

The first statement takes the data frame artists and pipes it into the arrange function [this is equivalent to arrange(artists, group)], and then saves the resulting new sorted data frame to the variable group_asc.

There is one thing that I don’t get: every time I make a new line I need to pipe it again, otherwise the new line will refer to the first pipe, right?
Why I don’t need to pipe the arrange line as well?
artists<-artists%>%
  select(-country,-year_founded,-albums) **%>%** 
    filter(spotify_monthly_listeners>20000000,genre!='Hip Hop')**%>%**
      arrange(desc(youtube_subscribers))
  head(artists)


I don’t quite follow your question. Perhaps you could elaborate a bit more.
artists <- artists %>%
  select(-country, -year_founded, -albums) %>%
  filter(spotify_monthly_listeners > 20000000, genre != 'Hip Hop') %>%
  arrange(desc(youtube_subscribers))
head(artists)

In this snippet, we


we take the data frame artists and pipe it to the select function. The country, year_founded and albums columns are excluded and a NEW data frame is returned by the select function. We haven’t done anything with this returned data frame yet. Neither have we assigned it to a variable yet NOR have we thrown it away yet.


The new data frame from the step 1 is now piped into the filter function and after filtering the rows according to our two conditions, another NEW data frame is returned. Again, this new data frame hasn’t been assigned or discarded yet.


Now, we take the data frame from step 2 and pipe it into the arrange function. The arrange function sorts the data frame in descending order of youtube_subscribers and returns a NEW data frame.


Finally, we assign the data frame from step 3 to the variable artists thereby overwriting our original artists data frame.


EDIT: Just to be clear, the piping symbol %>% goes between the data frame and the function.
dataFrame %>% function(...other arguments...)

Alternatively, just for formatting you could also write it as
dataFrame %>% 
  function(...other arguments...)

These above two lines are both equivalent to
function(dataFrame, ...other arguments...)

So, in the snippet we are discussing
artists <- artists %>% // Piping symbol of doing step 1
  select(-country, -year_founded, -albums) %>% // Piping symbol of doing step 2
  filter(spotify_monthly_listeners > 20000000, genre != 'Hip Hop') %>% // Piping symbol of doing step 3 
  arrange(desc(youtube_subscribers))
head(artists)


Now I got it.
So basically  need to pipe (%>%) every new function (line) if I want it to be used in the following line. The last line, if not piped, will finish the cycle.
Thanks for helping

So in this reshaping your data lesson how can the 2nd table be the more tidy out of the two? The 1st one makes more logical sense  and according to this article that is the case - as table 1 works better with the structure of R’s language. https://garrettgman.github.io/tidying/  (see section 2.1)

I thinks table 2 is more tidy because each row contains one observation (account, account type and amount) whereas in table 1 each row contains two observations (account, amount of checkings AND amount of savings). In table 2 the information of checkings and savings is seperated in different rows

I can’t seem to get past the 3rd step in this exercise.  I’m not sure how table() is supposed to work in this exercise. Any help is appreciated!

The hints only show the piping. You still have to make sure you make the variable assignments asked for in the exercise instructions.
In step 2, you pipe the students data frame to duplicated() AND make sure you assign the resulting vector object to the variable duplicates.
You would do so like
duplicates <- students %>%
  duplicated()

At this stage, the duplicates variable is a vector object consisting of the boolean TRUE/FALSE for each row (TRUE if the row is a duplicate row, FALSE otherwise).
In step 3, you simply edit the above code by doing an additional pipe to table().  So just edit the above code by tacking on %>% table().
duplicates <- students %>%
  duplicated() %>%
  table()
duplicates

This means you first pipe students to duplicated() AND then pipe the resulting vector object to table() and then assign the table with counts to duplicates.
At this stage, duplicates is a table with counts of all the FALSE and TRUE values in the vector object from step 2. The last line of the above code displays the counts table.

I don’t get why I can’ pass the 5th step.
Q: Use the  duplicated()  function again to make an object called  updated_duplicates  after dropping the duplicates. Pipe the result into  table()  to see if any duplicates remain, and view  updated_duplicates . Are there any  TRUE s left?
A:
updated_duplicates <- students %>% 
  duplicated() %>%
  table()
updated_duplicates

After several attempts, I checked the solution and what a surprise: it’s exactly the same. Is that a bug or am I making any typos I couldn’t see? I checked this chunk many times and, honestly, I can’t find any problem.
It’s not the first time I see this, same happened yesterday but also a few months ago in JavaScript course.

What message/feedback/error does the auto-grader display at the bottom?

Now I don’t remember it anymore… But does it makes any sense for you?

The code you posted is correct and I can’t spot any typos. It might be a bug. Sometimes, the feedback message offers some clues about what may have gone wrong.




 mtrtmk:

you posted is correct and I can’t spot any typos. It might be a bug. Sometimes, the feedback message offers some clues about what may have gone wrong.


Yes, that`s what I think… Same happened yesterday, but this one I do have the bug message. It’s from lesson 5:
# define pricey_shoes here:
pricey_shoes <- orders %>%
  group_by(shoe_type) %>%
  summarize(max_price = max(price, na.rm = TRUE))
print(pricey_shoes)

Error: Subscript can’t be missing for tibbles in [[.
Again, the answer was correct. I don’t know why this happens so often, I tried to clear my cache to check if it would help, but no. Maybe it was my internet connection? I was having some trouble connecting codecademy.

Definitely, seems to be a problem with Codecademy. When I completed this exercise a few days back, I didn’t have any issues. But just right now, I reset the pricey_shoes exercise (Calculating Aggregate Functions I) and I got the same Error: Subscript can’t be missing for tibbles in [[.
So, I don’t think you are doing anything wrong and I don’t think there is anything wrong with your internet connection. Looks like a problem at Codecademy’s end. This particular exercise was working fine few days back, but now it is bugged.

In this exercise, at the third step, where you have to state what decile a 170 second song would fall, I can’t answer it because there is no printout of the different values. The task pane on the right does not print out the values of the different deciles.
Edit: I have been piping the dataframe into the quantile command, if you don’t do that then there is a printout of the numbers.

It was mentioned in the hints/instructions of an earlier exercise that if we wish to use piping, then we should load the dplyr library.

Hi! In the previous chapter I was learning about data types in R (4/12). I learned we prefer single quotes to surround strings. However, in this learning chapter about variables, in the example double quotes are used. Is this because these things are variables? Or should I use single quotes in my string variables too?
Hope to get an answer!
Sincerely, Marja

Answer to your question is here.

Are double """" and single '' quotes (always) interchangeable in R?


r, quotes, double-quotes, single-quotes

Hi,
In question 1 I am asked:
Create a variable  name  with your first name as a string.
I enter:
name <- ‘Shannon’
I keep getting marked for an incorrect response and asked “did you declare a variable name of type character?”
After much frustration, I told the system to show the correct answer, which was:
name <- ‘Natalia’
I have zero idea why that answer is correct and why mine is incorrect… there is no difference in the code that I can discern. Please help!

You mean like this?

If so, the issue is where you typed your code.

For the sweet life of me I cannot figure out what is wrong with my code. And since the solution does not give an answer only to nr. 1 then I can’t figure out this first part.
Here’s what I have

I have the same issue ! It’s so frustrating.

You need one extra parenthesis before height_low_inches. Aside from that, it looks fine to me!

In order to find the product description that’s part of the product ordered in order_id 3 I used the code below.
Seems a bit elaborate to me.
Is there a quicker way?
Thanks,
Willem
order_3_product <- orders %>%
  filter(order_id == 3) %>%
  select(product_id)

order_3_description <- products %>%
  filter(product_id == order_3_product$product_id) %>% 
  select(description) 
order_3_description


it is just: order_3_description<-“thing-a-ma-jig”
this was so low level it took me half an hour. I wondered why I didn’t learn any code for this

You could refer to the table on the right of the screen. It has all the information you need already displayed on it. Hope I helped!

Hello. I was just wondering why in this exercise when you add a suffix argument to product_orders it doesn’t add a suffix to the product id? This was my code:
products_orders <- products %>%
inner_join(orders,
by = c(‘id’ = ‘product_id’),
suffix = c(’_product’, ‘_order’))
products_orders
but in the resulting table the first column was still just labeled id.

Firstly, in my opinion, the explanatory text seems inconsistent and inaccurate. The text up to “The resulting data frame will look like this:” and the embedded dataframe is fine. But, after that i.e. from “If we use this syntax, …” onward, the explanation doesn’t seem quite accurate. I think they should have used a slightly different example so that the subsequent discussion about suffixes would have been accurate and applicable to the example.
Putting that aside and getting back to your observation about the exercise, here is what I think is happening.
The products table has columns: id, description, price
The orders table has columns: id, product_id, customer_id, quantity, timestamp
As per the instructions, we can do an inner_join using the code you have mentioned i.e.:
products_orders <- products %>%
  inner_join(orders,
            by = c('id' = 'product_id'),
            suffix = c('_product', '_order'))

This does an inner_join using the id column from products and the product_id column from orders.
The resulting dataframe products_orders has all the columns from products and all the columns (except product_id) from orders. Because of the statement c('id' = 'product_id'), the common column between the two tables is labelled as id in the products_orders dataframe (taking on the label of the left table). The product_id column isn’t included as a separate explicitly labelled column, because the id column of products_orders table already holds the information common to both tables.
The products_orders dataframe also inherits an id column from the orders table. This shows up as id_order in the final table because of our specified suffixes.
If we read the R documentation for inner_join (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/join), the thing to note is:
suffix: If there are non-joined duplicate variables in  x and y , these suffixes will be added to the output to disambiguate them. Should be a character vector of length 2.
The key phrase is non-joined duplicate variables.
The columns of products_orders are: id, description, price, id_order, customer_id, quantity, timestamp
The first id column was actually used when we did the inner_join, so the suffixes don’t apply to it. The second id which was inherited from the orders table and wasn’t used in the join qualifies as being a non-joined duplicate variable. So, it takes on the suffix '_order'.
As an experiment, you can try playing around with the code to verify the above. Suppose, we omit the suffixes, then we see that the products_orders table has columns id and id.y

abcd906×346 24.3 KB

Now, let us do a inner_join with suffixes but on two nonsense columns (the motivation being that the final table will inherit an id column from each table and neither of the two id columns would have been used to do the join).

def817×180 13.8 KB

So, I did a nonsense inner_join between the price and product_id columns from the two tables. If you look at the screenshot, the resulting table has both an id_product and a id_order column BECAUSE neither of these columns was used to do the join. Hence, they qualify as being non-joined duplicate variables and the suffixes are applied to both of them.

i am not able to understand this although i can solve the exercise,
isn’t the function c() used for defining a vector in R?
so how does it work.

Yes, the c function can be used to create vectors in R.
join function documentation
c function documentation
If we look at the documentation for the join function, we can see that the suffix argument should “be a character vector of length 2”. We accomplish this by using the c function to create a vector of length 2 with the first member of the vector being used for non-joined duplicate variables from the left table, while the second member of the vector refers to those from the right table. e.g.
suffix = c('_product', '_order')


Again, if we look at the documentation for the join function, we can see that if the columns we are joining on have different names in the two tables, then we are expected to “To join by different variables on x and y use a named vector. For example, by = c(""a"" = ""b"") will match x.a to y.b .”
In our case, we are creating a named vector using the statement
by = c('id' = 'product_id')

This creates a vector with a single member ‘product_id’. We give this member the name ‘id’. For more on named vectors, you may want to look at:

The lesson says quantile() is a base R function, but when I looked up the documentation on the following site: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/quantile, it says quantile() is part of the stats package. Which is right?




 wiki-bot:

Quartiles


did you mean quartiles? vs quantiles

Hi,
I think they mean that quantile() is automatically loaded into R, and that you don’t need to manually load the package to be able to use the function (assuming you have a standard R setup of course).
You are indeed right that there is a (historical?) difference between the base and stats package, but for the common user there’s no real difference, and I think that’s an imprecision/simplification on their side, a simplification especially for people that come from programming in Python and other languages with a similar syntax, where everything that is not a basic function has to be imported.
All the best,
Theo

3 posts were split to a new topic: Cannot read property ‘0’ of null



Ok, so the solution to this one should be
if (weather == ‘cloudy’ & high_chance_of_rain) {
message <- “Pack umbrella!”
}
else {
message <- “No need for umbrella!”
}
print(message)
But it keeps throwing an error, “cannot read property 0 of null”. So it turns out that if, as in the example above, the “else” block begins on the line below the curly brace that closes the if statement, the error pops up. However it doesn’t pop up if both the closing brace and the else statement are on the same line. Had to write it like that just so that it would let me move on to the next exercise.

Hi!
My code was:
if (weather == ‘cloudy’ & high_chance_of_rain) {
message <- “Pack an umbrella!”
} else {
message <- “No need for umbrella!”
}
print(message)
but it was not accepted as a correct one - I got this message: Did you create a conditional statement and change the value of message to the string specified?
I see no difference in their solution and in my code. What am I missing?
Sabina

Hello, @sabinapovhe899448947. Welcome to the forum!



 sabinapovhe899448947:

if (weather == ‘cloudy’ & high_chance_of_rain) {
message <- “Pack an umbrella!”
} else {
message <- “No need for umbrella!”
}
print(message)


The string specified in this case is, ""Pack umbrella!"" not ""Pack an umbrella!""
Sometimes the SCT for the exercises is very picky. Happy coding!

Oh wow, didn’t even notice this  thank you! 

So when we are setting up, why don’t we need to set the high chance of rain to true?

Hello, @seanspencer117.
Welcome to the forums!
The skeleton code provided to us when we begin the exercise does just that:


So I wrote:
if (weather == ‘cloudy’ & high_change_of_rain) {
message <- “Pack umbrella!”}
else {message <- “No need for umbrella!”}
print (message)
I received an error ""Error in source(tempR).
The solution reads:
if (weather == ‘cloudy’ & high_chance_of_rain) {
message <- “Pack umbrella!”
} else {
message <- “No need for umbrella!”
}
print(message)
What’s the difference between mine and the solution?  Does it matter what line things are placed on?  If so, why don’t they cover that?

Look closely at your code. Read it carefully and deliberately. Sometimes reading it out loud helps. Don’t just say what you think the code says. Say what the code actually says.

I noticed I had a typo in my first message and I did actually have it as high_chance_of_rain in the exercise.
I’m reading both of them out loud…  “If weather equals cloudy and high_chance_of_rain is true then the message is Pack Umbrella!  If not, the message is No need for umbrella!  Print the message.”

Yeah. I was referring to the typo. Beyond that, (I’ve only ever dabbled in R) it appears that you cannot begin a new line of code with else. It seems in R syntax the else doesn’t know it belongs to the previous if unless it is on the same line as the closing } from the if.

Yes, that was it.  I asked in a reddit thread also and they said that the else has to be on the same line as the closing }.  I wish that would have been mentioned in the lesson - I have no idea how we would know that otherwise.

Got it, but there is something I still don’t fully understand. When I wrote the statement they ask, I am checking if variables have the value necessary for that specific message. Why shouldn’t I specify the value that high_chance_of_rain must check TRUE?

I assume that you are referring to the condition
if (weather == ‘cloudy’ & high_chance_of_rain) {…}

You would not need to include a condition high_chance_of_rain == True (which returns True if you were to run it on its own line), as the value of high_chance_of_rain already is True and would already be enough. We don’t need the equality check.
I hope I have interpreted your question right, if not, please feel free to reply.

I write my code, it shows Error in source(tempR) :
Then I ask for solution, which exactly what I had written and it works fine.

I have a problem in using the pipe-operator (%>%) in R during the course.
With this set, the code returns the message ‘object albums not found’.

artists %>%
no_albums <- select(-albums)

And this one gets green ticked;

no_albums <- select(artists,-albums)

Can someone please explain why I put a digit (like 1 or 2) and where I get that digit from at the end of a str_sub function? Thank you

core,
Do you mean put a digit like this?
students <- students %>%
  mutate(gender = str_sub(gender_age,1,1),
         age = str_sub(gender_age,2))
head(students)

In this case, the “1,1” are the first and last ‘characters’, or the letter M or F.  The range is 1 to 1.  It’s simply the position in the order of the characters.
For the age, you can use 2,3 or just 2 since the first ‘character’ you are interested in is in the second position and extends to the third position – the two digit age.

why when I copy this exact code into my markdown does it  not accept it as the answer? The table even shows the 2 new columns needed, I’ve even tried copying the solution from the answer and it still doesn’t work.

I went back to the page and reset the exercise.  Even after copy-paste with the solution it’s not working.  Sometimes the interface is flaky – I’ve seen this with numerous other exercises.

students <- students %>%
  mutate(gender = str_sub(gender_age,1,1),
         age = str_sub(gender_age,2))
head(students)

In this code, why only gender variable has 1,1 while age has just 2?
if each one of 1 denotes start and end, shouln’t the same prinple be applied to gender?

Exactly my thoughts, i dont know why age only has (2) when i thought it would be (2,3) to denote the start and end position… ?

@board2294627802 i assume the function has to work within a data frame and it takes its first argument as the target column, its second argument as the first part of the string you want to start splicing, and will continue to take the rest of the string if the optional third argument isn’t supplied, otherwise it stops at third specified argument…
Hope this helps.

You are correct, @davidgarcia719776693.  An example is the string M14.  The str_sub(gender_age,1,1)  takes only the “M”, and the str_sub(gender_age,2) takes everything from the 2 on – that is, the 14.

Hi harrjt
How did you solve the problem? It’s not working either for me…

It seems a bit erratic, so I filed a bug report.  Be sure to complete step 3. completely before going to step 4.  Even then, it sometimes marks step 3 wrong; and then step 4 after moving on…gremlins!
```{r}
# print columns of students
colnames(students)

# view head of students
head(students)

# add gender and age columns
students <- students %>% mutate(
  gender = str_sub(gender_age,1,1),
  age = str_sub(gender_age,2))
head(students)

# drop gender_age column
students <- students %>%
  select(-gender_age)
head(students)

I’ll delete the code once this gets fixed.

Also, the lesson says to paste students %>%    summarise(mean_score = mean(score)) into the code, but I had to type it by hand because Codecademy never lets me paste anything into it (the one exception being during the course, https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code).

I think it would be good to mention in this or a previous lesson that an Rda file can contain multiple data frames and other objects. Perhaps it was mentioned though, I am not sure, sorry about that. I remember Rda files being introduced in a previous lesson, but there was a sole data frame in it in that case, which had the same name as the file. Now it took me some time to understand where in the code were the nba_data and okcupid_data data frames loaded and what was the (wrongly perceived by me) lesson_data data frame loaded for.

Can someone please explain what this command means? And how does it apply to both the files at the same time?
clean_data_frame <- 2

hi! the instructions wanted you to examine which of the data sets was clean. if grocery_1 was clean, you would define clean_data_frame <- 1, but if grocery_2 was clean, we would define it as clean_data_frame <- 2.
grocery_2 was formatted correctly and was therefore ‘clean’, and accordingly we wrote
clean_data_frame <- 2
I’m not exactly sure why tho.

So can someone explain the reasoning behind why grocery_2 is considered “clean and tidy.” It seems to me that grocery_1 data frame is the tidy one, as it is concise, not redundant, and contains more data in numeric form for easy analysis.

Same confusion to begin with. However,  it looks like grocery_2 is the Tableau format data frame while grocery_1 is the Excel format. I have some experience working with Tableau before. Tableau looks at the data set by column. If you input an Excel format data frame, it cannot make sense of the data. For example, if you put grocery_1 into Tableau and drag Cake_recipe into the sheet, it will add all the quantities for different materials together (2 eggs + 1 milk + 2 flours = 5 total ingredients for cake_recipe!) but that is not what we are interested in. We want to see how many eggs to buy. grocery_2 can do this easily. You put Grocery_item as a filter and select Egg, then it will add all the Numbers in the rows with Egg (2 + 3). This sounds redundant yes, a bit stupid but I guess the problem is many data analytic tools cannot cross check the row and the col. They go col by col. - Personal understanding.

i don’t understand the concept of data cleaning how do they particularly assign value 2 to clean_data_frame without checking if the data is clean or not. can somebody explain please.

This isn’t really checking anything within the data frame or code; Codecademy programmed in a question for you to answer like a mini quiz. You enter your response by setting the variable as 1 or 2.
As gigapro59152 stated, the answer actually depends on what you’re using to analyze the tool (and somewhat what types of questions you’re asking from the data set).

I couldn’t understand why data one was not clean and data 2 was clean
the first gives list of how much quantity
and second one gives which item in which list

Ooooh, I thought it was saying to make an if-then statement

I’m having difficulty understanding the results of calling summary(results) and summary(results_new). Can someone please tell me where the p-values are?

I had the same question. From other sources on the internet, without being too sure, I think Pr(>F) is what we are interested in in this case. Look up anova, f value and Pr(>F) to be sure though.

Hi,
Please note for my answer that I am not able to see the lesson and the prompt.
If you are looking for a p-value of an ANOVA, you are indeed looking in the right place: It’s the number in the column Pr(>F). It tells you the probability of seeing the data as you have it in your dataset if you assume the null hypothesis, which, in this case, is
“There is no difference between the sales of the different store categories”
The lower the p-value, the lower the probability of seeing such a sample given the null hypothesis, and if it is lower than a certain significance level, then we can conclude that we have evidence to suggest rejecting the null hypothesis, pointing us in favour of the alternative hypothesis,
“There is a difference between the sales of the different store categories.”
Note that you can never really “accept”  the null or the alternative categories, since you might have a “weird” dataset which does not properly represent the population of stores, or some assumptions of the ANOVA are not met, or there might be many other issues with the dataset or the process.
I hope this helps, and all the best,

A bit confused here over the extra = “merge” argument, why (and how) does it work? Merge is types as a character string, how come it behaves like a function?
And what do I do if I want a middle name to belong to the first_name column instead of the last?
Thanks in advance 

I keep getting errors by not putting column names in quotes…why, in certain functions, like separate(), do the column names have to be put in quotes, and others, like select(), they do not?  Is this something that has to be memorized, or is there a rule?




 claraii:

A bit confused here over the extra = “merge” argument, why (and how) does it work? Merge is types as a character string, how come it behaves like a function?


Have a look at the R documentation for separate.
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3/topics/separate
As you can see, the data frame (which can be piped as in the exercise), the column name, and the names of new columns (as a character vector) are to be passed to the separate function. We did this with
students %>% 
  separate(full_name, c('first_name', 'last_name'), ...)

There are other optional parameters for the separate function which you can see in the documentation (such as sep, remove, convert, extra, fill). If you don’t pass any arguments for these parameters, then their default values are used. The default for extra is ‘warn’, but when you write extra='merge', you choose to use this value instead of the default. extra isn’t a function, it is an optional parameter.



 claraii:

And what do I do if I want a middle name to belong to the first_name column instead of the last?


One way would be to do as Alexey has done in this StackOverFlow post.

  on 06:16PM - 13 Oct 15 UTC







He has basically used a regex (regular expression) pattern to use the last space before the end of line as the separator. In the exercise, we used "" "" as the separator. Alexey has used "" (?=[^ ]+$)"" as the separator. For the meanings of ?, [^ ], + and $, you can search the regex wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression for these symbols (or some other handy regex reference sheet).

You have to use the documentation. Whenever you want to do something new, first you have to do a search for any packages, commands or functions that can help you accomplish the task. Then, you have to read their documentation. There is no rule which will instantly tell you the interface of functions. If you use some function frequently, you will pretty much remember which arguments make sense. If you take a long break, things can fade from memory. So, a handy reference sheet of common functions or re-reading the documentation should bring you up to speed. Memorizing isn’t the goal. As long as you know where to look if you are unsure about something, you are fine.
If you look at the snippet for separate,
df %>%
  separate(col_to_separate, c('new_col_name_1','new_col_name_2'), ...)

you can see that the column name to be separated isn’t in quotes, but the new columns names are in quotes. Before using the separate function, you would have a look at the documentation to better understand what it does, what are its parameters, any examples, and any remarks or features which may be of note. If you look at the documentation for the separate function
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3/topics/separate
you will see that the col parameter accepts column name or position, so we don’t need quotes when passing this argument. On the contrary, the documentation mentions that the into parameter accepts “Names of new variables to create as character vector”.  Character is one of the data types in R, and a character vector would consist of a vector containing objects having character type. Character types have quotes around them. Reading the documentation is how we figure out the expected format of the arguments. One way to create character vectors is through the c() function as done in the exercise. You can read the documentation of this function as well https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/c

I’m confused about the example versus the solution to the instructional part. In the example given during the lesson, the columns are split into two new columns. When outputting the new table, the table shows the original column with the two new columns next to it. In the exercise, after splitting the column into two new columns, the original column is removed. Which is the actual output of using the select() function? (Does it keep the original column or not?)

Yes, you are correct. The example is a bit inconsistent.
If we look at the documentation for the separate function,
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3/topics/separate
we see that you can pass an optional argument remove which lets you specify whether you want to keep or remove the original column. The default value of remove is TRUE, so as we see in the instructional part, we didn’t pass the remove argument and the full_name column was removed in the new data frame and replaced with two new columns. if we had used the code
students <- students %>%
  separate(full_name, c('first_name', 'last_name'), ' ', extra = 'merge', remove = FALSE)

then, the resulting dataframe would include all the three columns i.e. full_name, first_name, last_name
The example should have been coded like
# Create the 'user_type' and 'country' columns
df %>%
  separate(type,c('user_type','country'),'_', remove = FALSE)

Since, the remove argument wasn’t used in the example, so you are correct that the result shouldn’t have the original type column.

Thank you! For coding language, specifics are important

If you add this code at the end of the lesson:
students

and scroll through to the 12th page, you’ll see an example of why you want to use merge.

A bit late but thanks a lot for your lenghty answer !! I see how it works now! 

image1355×615 184 KB
I’m confused with the error that’s popping up. Didn’t I do that? The notebook shows that the full_name column has been split into first_name and last_name, too, so I really don’t understand.

Two things from the screenshot:


You used extra='merge ' instead of extra='merge'


You used c('first_name', 'last_name', ' ', extra='merge') instead of c('first_name', 'last_name'), ' ', extra='merge'



I might be blind, but is the space the only difference?

Nevermind, got it! Thanks for your help!

Hi,
In the introduction to R Syntax under “Calculations” I believe there is an error (unless I’m missing something). The error
Results in “500”
573 - 74 + 1
^ in the above, if we’re working with good old order of operations of “PEMDAS” addition should happen prior to subtraction. So it would be 74+1=75 and then 573-75=498
Or have I missed something?
I know this is a small detail but I became obssesed with it and I’m grateful for your thoughts…

Hello, I entered the following “25 * 4 + 9 / 3” under the notebook.Rmd but when I pressed “Run” I did not get a numeric result. Instead I got a message that says “Did you calculate the equation inside your R notebook?”…I thought notebook.Rmd was the R notebook…am I missing something?
Thank you!

Hello, @pyace87095.
Sorry, for replying so late, but I just noticed your post.
You’ve ignored the sign. 74 is a negative number. If you want to do the addition first, you have to add 1 to -74. That gives you -73. 573 - 73 = 500. Addition and subtraction is essentially a sum of a list of values. You have 3 values here: 573, -74, 1.

Hello, @ashleybarnes00527705, and welcome to the forums.
Sounds like you may have not entered your code in the correct space, or if you included the quotation marks like you show in your post, that would be an issue as well.

Your code should go where I’ve indicated in the screenshot.
Happy coding!

Apparently (and I’m guessing here), the spaces between the numbers and mathematical signs are important…  I had the same issue you had, with same response of “did you calculate…”, and finally had to have code academy “solve for me”.  The only difference I could find between what I entered and what code academy displayed were spaces between each value [  25 * 4 + 9 / 3  ]… if this is what caused the issue, I would think, given that this course is for people with zero experience or background in coding and R, that it would be paramount to communicate the need to use a space… Hoping it only gets better from here.

Hi -
Completely new to codecademy and r. The first exercise we are asked to perform a simple calculation 25 * 4 + 9 / 3. Below is the solution:
title: “Introduction to R Syntax”
output: html_notebook
25 * 4 + 9 / 3

My question is why does {r} need to be included? and what function does the ``` perform?
Thank you

Hi array4025038106,
Codecademy uses something called R Markdown to embed R code. It is basically a way to include commentary and explanations in the same place with your code, and all graphics that it produces. Researchers use it to make their analysis reproducible by other people, and for many other things!
The syntax '''{r} tells R Markdown that it should expect some R code to follow, and another ''' closes the code block. If you’re interested, here’s some info on code chunks from the manual:


bookdown.org



2.6 R code chunks and inline R code | R Markdown: The Definitive Guide
The first official book authored by the core R Markdown developers that provides a comprehensive and accurate reference to the R Markdown ecosystem. With R Markdown, you can easily create reproducible data analysis reports, presentations, dashboards,...





I hope this helps, and all the best,

Hello–I’m having a problem with this–
Can anyone see where I’m wrong?  I am getting a “cant rename columns that don’t exist” error–I’ve checked spelling and such and nothing seems to be wrong?
dogs %>%
rename(avg_height = avg_height_inches,
avg_weight = avg_weight_lbs,
rank_change_13_to_16 = popularity_change_13_to_16)

Hi,
I was getting the same error. You have to reverse the order of what comes before and after the = sign.
dogs<- dogs %>%
rename(avg_height_inches = avg_height,
avg_weight_lbs = avg_weight,
popularity_change_13_to_16 = rank_change_13_to_16)

I have been working on this exercise for a while and entered this code:
shoe_counts <- orders %>%
group_by(shoe_type, shoe_color) %>%
summarize(count = n())
shoe_counts
but I keep getting an error that says "" Did you group_by() the shoe_type and shoe_color columns and call summarize() , finding the count n() of rows in each group, and save the result to shoe_counts ?""
When I ask for the solution, this is the code it supplies:
shoe_counts <- orders %>%
group_by(shoe_type, shoe_color) %>%
summarize(count = n())
shoe_counts
It looks the same to me. Could someone explain what the issue is? Thanks!

Similar problem like 1 task back - the task is not defined well. System refuses to accept my solution:
shoe_prices <- orders %>%
  group_by(shoe_type, shoe_material) %>%
  summarize(mean_prices = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
shoe_prices

and when clicking ""give me the right solution, I get:
shoe_prices <- orders %>%
  group_by(shoe_type, shoe_material) %>%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
shoe_prices

The code is the same - except the name assigned to the calculated aggregate. But the name we are supposed to use was not stated anywhere in the instructions and that cannot be any problem as I get the right solution with any other name.

+1 also experiencing this, codecademy grading kept failing 'til i changed the custom variable name to exactly  ‘mean_price’

Hello,
Why is there no cheat sheet for variance and standard deviation? Also for the cheat sheet on hypothesis testing, the p-value isn’t the probability of the null hypothesis being true; it already assumes the null is true.
Just a heads up. :^)

What is the number format, and how to identify the values as numeric/integer types ?

I agree that this was not explained sufficiently in the exercise. I needed to Google to figure this exercise out. c() stands for concatenate and is used regardless of the type of data (from the example and without explanation I assumed this was how we were defining the data type as character). The values are defined as numeric, simply by using numbers and not surrounding them with quotes.

Arguably, this lesson should require a phone number as a vector of character strings (due to potential for leading zeros, eg 555-111-0981
The form of the phone number is not internationally friendly - perhaps a different type of data that is a list that can be represented as numbers (date of birth perhaps).

The type of elements in my vector were “double”. What does this mean ?

Very basic question but why in the example are the months in quotation marks but in the numeric solution we don’t include quotes? Thanks!!

The months are in quotations because they’re considered a character, while the numbers are considered numeric and not characters (in this instance).

This happens by default.
The two most common numeric classes used in R are integer and double (for double precision floating point numbers).
When you create a numeric vector using the  c()  function it automatically will produce a vector of double precision numeric values.
“Double” is a data type to denote a big floating number.
https://uc-r.github.io/integer_double/ <- source
youtube.com/watch?v=PZRI1IfStY0 <- Explains floating point numbers

Is the function length(vector_name) misspelled?? English is not my first language and I don´t want to look like an idiot, but isn´t it “lenght”?

why the inner_join of checkouts and visits has so many rows as output? Both only have 6 rows, but the output has 80 rows. Why is that?

systemwhiz,
Try this:
# inspect visits and checkouts here:
head(visits)
nrow(visits)
head(checkouts)
nrow(checkouts)

You can see there are 100 rows in visits and 80 rows in checkouts.  The head() only returns the first six rows unless you ask for a greater number.  Since there are 80 rows in checkouts that correspond to those in visits, you get all 80.

hey everyone, is there a method to change the Time column from seconds to minutes and so on!
and thanks.

Hi guys,
just wondering, for this exercise why are we applying a LOESS model to a model with two variables that share a linear relationship? Tried finding more information online about LOESS and they seem to point to it being used as a smoothing function for CURVES rather than lines like in this case?
The method that I came across most often while searching for a situation like that (where two variables share a linear relationship) and you’re trying to find out the strength of that relationship is to use the least squares method.
Thanks!

I am confused by the IF/ElSE exercise.  What exactly is being evaluated here?
I would expect IF/ELSE to be more along the lines of
Variable1 = 2
Variable2 = 3
If Variable1 > Variable2:  do something
Else: do something different.
So what exactly are we evaluating to see whether or not it is true?
message <- ""I change based on a condition.""
if (TRUE) {
  message <- ""I execute this when true!""
} else {
  message <- ""I execute this when false!""
}
print(message)


You did nothing wrong. It’s very buggy/messed up. You have the same solution as the answer

How do I find the curly brackets?

I was stuck on this questions as well. I believe the difference is single quotes vs double quotes surrounding each message. (Double quotes give an error?)

Probably an obvious question, but it does not say in the cheat sheet or on the exercise, but do conditionals only work with ‘logical’ data types.
For example, could the if/else statements be dependent on ‘numerical’ or ‘character’ data as well?
i.e. if(x>10) {print(‘x is greater than 10’)} else {print(‘X is not greater than 10’)}

this is cofusing.
if (true) … if what is true? there is no condition here. Is this testing if the variable exists?
Shouldn’t this be
if (message = “I execute this when false!”) {message <- “I execute when true!”}
else {message <- “I execute this when false!”}

I learn better when I understand the fundamentals of the evaluation. What is being evaluated as true or false in this situation?
It was easy to pass the lesson but it feels like I am only learning the R syntax and not the logic behind R. I hope this will go into more detail in later sections.

I used double quotes and passed the exercise with no problems.

@text9311646494 @danielsinclair030878 @jmac32935
yes, the logic behind simply typing TRUE into an if statement (which takes an evaluation of a logical statement) isn’t fully explained here. But in other programing languages true always evaluates to being true, it will never print the else statement. hope this helps!

So to understand the exercise correctly, there would not be a situation in which the “else”-statement would be printed the way it is coded?
And how would you go about adding the condition that needs to evaluated as either true or false?

Single/double quotes did not matter to me, but changing the spacing so else is on the same line as the end curly braces and an extra empty line between the end curly brace and print statement passed it for me. Is R white-space sensitive or is this just Codecademy’s grading system being wonky for this exercise?

Hi! I ended the else line with }; as I usually do in SQL and I passed but I would say the space is more correct in R.
Answer:
message <- “I change based on a condition.”
if (TRUE) {
message <- “I execute this when true!”
} else {
message <- “I execute this when false!”
}
print(message)

Second this answer. Thanks for sharing

What is the point of the intermediary variable used within the summarize function, such as:

summarize(var_name=command(column))

We have to use another variable name at the beginning:

max_val <- df %>%
summarize(max_col = max(col))

I don’t see why we need both, or how they differ.

I don’t understand why all of the examples in the prompt begin with the select() function, as that indicates you need to specify which column you are operating on. I guess you don’t have to do that, as the actual example in the instructions doesn’t require that step. So I guess it’s unnecessary?

I don’t see why we need the summarize function at all here. I am getting valid output with:
most_expensive <- max(orders$price, na.rm = TRUE)
However I’m getting a failure from codecademy’s grading system.

I have the same question as jniager3. Does anyone have an update on this?
Why does the variable need to be defined in the max function when the variable must be defined in the beginning?
What is the purpose of the summarize function if it could be ignored using melecityjones method?

You may be getting a failure from the grading system since it’s scoring based on your input and not your output.  While you use a different syntax, you are still “piping” orders. What is the column name you get when you don’t use the recommended syntax?

I was confused by this assignment too. But after completing the assignment that comes after this one, it all makes sense to me now.
They simply want to demonstrate the syntax for aggregating in R.
We’re basically creating a new DF under a new variable name with new columns that is the aggregated data, while dropping the original columns. It is kind of similar to transmute().
# assigning new DF name:
most_expensive <- orders %>%

# The following line is unnecessary, but it follows the same syntax when we start using groupby() in the next assignment. Same logic as a default parameter :
  select(price) %>%

# summarize aggregates the data into one row, it doesn't make sense now but it will when you apply groupby() on the next assignment.
  summarize(new_column_name = max(price, na.rm=TRUE))

most_expensive



Can anyone explain what this comment mean? what is “parsing” and which  value in the df is missing?

  what does it mean?

I believe there is a bug / not clear instructions in:
Calculating Aggregate Functions I. (part 3/7).
The program refused my solution:
# define pricey_shoes here:
pricey_shoes <- orders %>%
  group_by(shoe_type) %>%
  summarize(pricey_shoes = max(price, na.rm = TRUE))
pricey_shoes

Instead - when clicking “show me the correct solution”, it displayed this code:
# define pricey_shoes here:
pricey_shoes <- orders %>%
  group_by(shoe_type) %>%
  summarize(max_price = max(price, na.rm = TRUE))
pricey_shoes

The only difference is in the “aggregate_name” - name assigned to the calculated aggregate. But there was no instruction which name we should assign to the aggregate and my solution was showing exactly what was required.

This happened to me too, I had to guess the column name (max_price) based on the previous exercise, it wouldn’t accept another. The previous exercise accepted different names, but I had something else wrong and had thus seen the given solution.

The same problem is present in the next part of the instructions, where you have to guess that “count” is the variable name they’re looking for. Rather frustrating

+1 Experiencing same issue. Codecademy grading wasn’t running as successful until custom variable in the summarize statement was specifically ‘max_price’

Glad I wasn’t the only one. Needless to say, they should either provide the variable name or make it so that it’d pass regardless of variable name.

It’s easy to fix this issue for the author in any of 2 ways:

Indicate anywhere in the task, that the the agregate_name must be “max_price”.
Let the agregate name to be whatever, it’s easy to let this check pass without the exact match.

I was quite frustrated while dealing with this dumb obstacle, many may be quite disappointed or even demotivated by it as well.

For question 3 in this part, I’m wondering what’s the difference between month preceding utm_source and vice versa. When I put month as the first argument in group_by(), it appears an error.
However, the solution simply puts the utm_source before month. Why?


There is no good reason, apparently.
Just the “tradition” to give this type of rows names like “count”, most likely.
I would suggest to remove this error trigger or to put somewhere in the task an explicit pointer to the name of such aggregated_value.

Is there any difference between the variance() function we learned here and the var() summary function we learned during Aggregates in R?

Yes. The var() function calculates a sample variance, while the variation() function calculates a population variance. The difference is better explained in a separate course of statistics, but basically var() makes an estimation for the whole population based on a sample of data (quicker and precise enough for many purposes).
