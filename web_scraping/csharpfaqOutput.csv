1,Need help with error code CS0117!,"Get Help,Git",classes-objects,4,"
I need help with an error code which I got when on the c# course.
Screenshot 2020-07-29 at 14.49.271194×437 34.9 KB
This is the code I wrote
","
Hi there.
In future please can you provide your code in a reusable form - for example, by correctly formatting it and posting it in your topic when you ask for help..
Also, the full text of the error message is most helpful - in no small part, because usually the error gives you the line and column number of where the error occurred.
On this occasion, however… CS0117 is an error of 'type' does not contain a definition for 'identifier'. Given that you are attempting to call Console.WriteLines(), which does not exist, I suspect that might be the cause of your error.
(The LE error probably told you as much, because if I make a similar call in a REPL to Console.WriteLines(""Boo!""); I get back: main.cs(10,13): error CS0117: 'System.Console' does not contain a definition for 'WriteLines')

thank you!
I understand this already, but how would I fix this issue?

Well, seeing as how the issue is error CS0117: 'System.Console' does not contain a definition for 'WriteLines' I’d say you need to fix that line of code. The error message will be telling you where the fault is - in my case, it was Line 10 Col 13 but your code will be different.
Since you’ve made multiple calls to methods provided by System.Console elsewhere in your code, it shouldn’t be too hard for you to re-read what you’ve written and find how the line that the compiler is complaining about differs from others in your program.

2,ExquisiteCorpse - Call method with random arguments,"Get Help,Git",methods,8,"
I am doing the first extension to the ExquisiteCorpse project: “Extend the  BuildACreature()  method so that all of its parameters are optional. It should assign a random body part if a parameter is not specified.”
It seems straightforward to make the parameters optional, thus:
static void BuildACreature(string head = “bug”, string body = “bug”, string feet = “bug”)
How can I randomise a body part if no argument is specified? I’ve searched the .NET documentation to no avail.
Full code:
using System;
namespace ExquisiteCorpse
{
class Program
{
static void Main(string args)
{
BuildACreature(body: “monster”);
}
    static void BuildACreature(string head = ""bug"", string body = ""bug"", string feet = ""bug"")
    {
        int headNum = TranslateToNumber(head);
        int bodyNum = TranslateToNumber(body);

        SwitchCase(headNum, bodyNum, feetNum);
    }

Isn’t that two separate problems? Determining whether something was specified, and choosing a random value from some set of alternatives?
If you’re trying to find one thing that solves both, maybe that’s why you don’t find anything.

I don’t think that’s two separate things. All I want to know is if I can have a method signature with something like:
static void BuildACreature(string head = RandomMode1, string body = RandomMode2, string feet = RandomMode3)
So the default value would be randomly generated. It should be possible, because the Codecademy question is: “Extend the  BuildACreature()  method so that all of its parameters are optional. It should assign a random body part if a parameter is not specified.”
Of course, I may be barking up the wrong tree, but that’s another matter.




 willjsaunders:

I don’t think that’s two separate things.


In C# it is. A default value has to be assigned prior to compiling. The result of a call to another method may eventually be a value, but it isn’t resolved prior to compiling. See this simplified example. After running the code as is, uncomment the commented out code, and run it again noting the exception thrown.
You could assign a default value of say an empty string, and then test each parameter inside the method. If it is an empty string, assign a random value instead.




 willjsaunders:

“Extend the BuildACreature() method so that all of its parameters are optional. It should assign a random body part if a parameter is not specified.”


That’s expressed as two separate things.
If missing
choose random

I am struggling with that part as well.
I tried to rebuild the BuildACreature() method like this:
static void BuildACreature(string head = """", string body = """", string feet ="""")
    {
      if (head == """")
      {
        Random randomNumber = new Random();
        int headInt = randomNumber.Next(1,4);
        switch (headInt)
      {
        case 1:
          GhostHead();
          break;
          
        case 2:
          BugHead();
          break;
          
        case 3:
          MonsterHead();
          break;
          
        default:
          Console.WriteLine(""Error. No valid number."");
          break;
      }
      }
      else if (body == """")
      {
        Random randomNumber = new Random();
        int bodyInt = randomNumber.Next(1,4);
        switch (bodyInt)
      {
        case 1:
          GhostHead();
          break;
          
        case 2:
          BugHead();
          break;
          
        case 3:
          MonsterHead();
          break;
          
        default:
          Console.WriteLine(""Error. No valid number."");
          break;
      }
      }
      else if (feet == """")
      {
        Random randomNumber = new Random();
        int feetInt = randomNumber.Next(1,4);
        switch (feetInt)
      {
        case 1:
          GhostHead();
          break;
          
        case 2:
          BugHead();
          break;
          
        case 3:
          MonsterHead();
          break;
          
        default:
          Console.WriteLine(""Error. No valid number."");
          break;
      }
      }
      else
      {
        int headNum = TranslateToNumber(head);
        int bodyNum = TranslateToNumber(body);
        int feetNum = TranslateToNumber(feet);
        SwitchCase (headNum, bodyNum, feetNum);
      }
    }

If I call the method in Main() it doesn’t throw an error and it kind of works, BUT it only prints random heads - my creature doesn’t have a body or feet.  Calling the method with one parameter works as well, but it only prints the head of the creature i entered, e.g BuildACreature (“monster”) only prints a monster head withoud body or feet.
So  I am stuck at these phase. If somebody has an idea how to chage the code it would be very helpful.

Check your code again, all of your switch cases refer back to methods featuring “Head”. 

I’m pretty late to reply, but I had the same problem and similar code.
By changing the “else if” to just “if” the rest of the monster printed.
I’m pretty new to coding, so I may be wrong, but it seems to me that using “if…else if…” statements makes the program stop after one condition is satisfied.
I hope his helps someone!

3,Any Book Reccomendations for C# beginners?!,"Get Help,Git",general,2,"
Hello,
I have been searching online for a while looking for a book that teaches C# but is easy to read and understand and perhaps shows examples and practice codes for someone to follow along with. Codecademy is great but I think having a book that can go further in depth with the course topics would be very beneficial!
Have a great day!

I hear Pro C# 7: With .NET and .NET Core by Andrew Troelson is beginner-friendly yet covers advanced topics as well (so it’d serve as a reference later).
That being said I haven’t read it myself. I’d recommend hitting specific C# channels on discord, reddit, and irc.

This is the script that throws the error.
// Mage.cs

I can post the other scripts if needed.  Please help.

Maybe add one thing at a time, compiling after each addition, and if something goes wrong you can reconsider what you were doing and what that needs to look like.
I imagine your code might compile if you remove your CastRainStorm which is what your error message is pointing at, and then you can continue from there.

I do hit save (compile) after each change.  Yes, if I remove that line it compiles.  However, in the project they want you to add that.  So, that is where I am stuck.

Give the Mage a new spell:  CastRainStorm() . It should be public with return type  Storm . In the body of the method, construct a new  Storm  object and return it.


So you’re adding a method for some class? Which class? Where would a method for a class go?
That’s something you can look up one way or another, that’s what you would need to consider for the thing you’re adding.
What did you put your method inside, does it go there?

Are you being rhetoric to make me think about that, or are you asking and need me to post more code @ionatan?

First option.
Make sure your lego bricks fit together.
class Something {
    public int MyMethod() {
    }
}

Adding a method to a class looks something like that (I don’t write csharp so it’s probably somewhat wrong but close enough), right. But that’s not the modification you made.

I’ll think about that some more, but I’m stuck on trying to figure out why its telling me this.

Mage.cs(10,7): error CS0106: The modifier ‘public’ is not valid for this item [/home/ccuser/workspace/learn-csharp-interfaces-inheritance-csharp-supernatural-inheritance/MagicalInheritance.csproj]

Basically, I don’t know why its not valid for “this item”.
These are the reasons MS tells me, and from it I can’t make sense of what went wrong?

The modifier ‘modifier’ is not valid for this item

A class or interface member was marked with an invalid access modifier. The following examples describe some of these invalid modifiers:

The static and public modifiers are not permitted on interface methods.
The static modifier is not permitted on a local function.
The  public  keyword is not allowed on an explicit interface declaration. In this case, remove the  public  keyword from the explicit interface declaration.
The abstract keyword is not allowed on an explicit interface declaration because an explicit interface implementation can never be overridden.
Access modifiers are not allowed on a local function. Local functions are always private.

In prior releases of Visual Studio, the  static  modifier was not permitted on a class, but  static  classes are allowed starting with Visual Studio 2005.

However, the step is asking me to make it public


Give the Mage a new spell:  CastRainStorm()  . It should be public with return type  Storm  . In the body of the method, construct a new  Storm  object and return it.


But MS is telling me that is not permitted?

The way that code files are generally read (parsed) is by matching everything in the code file to known patterns (syntax/grammar)
So long as you’re still matching known patterns, everything is fine, but if the parser encounters something that doesn’t match anything then it’ll stop reading and report the location where it stopped reading
If a parser error doesn’t make too much sense to you and you feel like you know what you’re doing somewhat in general, then forget about the message and instead think about how that all should have fit together.
And this is definitely such a case, the compiler knows nothing about what you mean/want so it can never meaningfully tell you how something should be.

OK, so I’m going to backtrack a step, since I am suspicious of my work on the previous step.

Add a  Mage  constructor with one  string  argument. It should call the  base  constructor with that same argument.

Is the following code correct in what it is asking for me to do?  I feel like if this was incorrect then everything in scope is the reason for failing.
// Mage.cs
using System;

namespace MagicalInheritance
{
  public class Mage : Pupil
  {
    public Mage(string title) : base(title)
    {

    }
  }
}


Yes it compiles, but I’m wondering if this step was done correctly, leading to the reason I am failing the next step?

Hmm. Well, how would we measure that?
Behaviour would be good to test, I think? Does that have the desired behaviour?
... Main ... {
    new Mage()  // does this invoke the body of the constructor?
}

Whether it compiles is a pretty good indicator here, there aren’t a whole lot of possible valid things you could do.
Maybe the compiler is the only thing you care about satisfying right now.
Your class should have a constructor, and a method. They both go into the class don’t they? So you’d put both in the class. Done. (That is how these lego blocks fit isn’t it, that’s what we need to be doing in this situation)
You can also try writing the code without the constructor, and just the method for now. If you can get each of them to work on their own, how should they look together?

My suspicion lies with the use of “Title” or “title”.  I can’t tell which one I should use.  I can’t tell from the compiler messages if either matters.  I just know that “Title” is inherited from “Pupil” (I think?).  But when I reference the hint, it hints to use lowercase title, similar to how its also seen in the Pupil class.
Basically I’m just getting more confused at this point now 
// Pupil.cs
using System;

namespace MagicalInheritance
{
  public class Pupil
  {
    public string Title { get; private set; }
   //Cconstructor with one argument, that sets the Title property 
    public Pupil(string title)
    {
      Title = title;
    }
    //Give the Pupil its single spell: CastWindStorm() Public, return type Storm. In the body of the method, construct a new Storm object and return it.
    public Storm CastWindStorm()
    {
      Storm s = new Storm(""wind"", false, Title);
      return s;
    }
  }
}```

If the compiler doesn’t complain it doesn’t care. I don’t know csharp naming conventions other than that a whole lot of things are title cased where they aren’t in other languages but that says nothing about your case.
Do arrays have a size attribute? Is that title cased? That’d be the equivalent thing.
Also, your Mage.cs isn’t really any different from Pupil.cs, so, how did you do the same thing there?

If you mean the multiple variables then obviously you’ll need to keep in mind which one of them you mean and possibly disambiguate if the names collide in some way

Point of the lesson (I gather) is that each one is going to inherit from the other.  So, what (I assume) you do in one wont necessarily be what you might do in another due to inheritance.  Reason the other works (I assume) and this one does not, despite them seemingly being the same, appears to me due to again, inheritance.  That is why I was suspicious of these two lines being wrong, yet compiling because it satisfies the compiler.  I assume the Mage inheriting Pupil was done correctly.  I’m still suspicious of the latter.  I’m mostly confident this was done correctly

In  Mage.cs , define an empty  Mage  class that inherits from  Pupil .

So its the next step that has me curious.

Add a  Mage  constructor with one  string  argument. It should call the  base  constructor with that same argument.

  public class Mage : Pupil
  {
    public Mage(string title) : base(title)
    {

    }
  }```

Hmm, I don’t know why I didn’t try this, and wondering if this change is going to lead me down the right path.
// Mage.cs
using System;

namespace MagicalInheritance
{
  public class Mage : Pupil
  {
    Mage(string title) : base(title)
    {

    }
  }
}```

Remove the inheritance while you fix it then. But no it makes no difference to syntax (why would it)

I don’t know why it would or wouldn’t.  That’s how new I am to C#.

So anyway to skirt around it a bit less.
You’d start with this, yes?
class Something {



}

Then shove in the things that should be in it.
class Something {
   

  // put a constructor here




  // put a method here


}

You have a class. In the class you’d put contstructors, properties, fields, methods.
Yes, that’s what you’re doing wrong, trivial as it may seem.
That is the pattern that you’re looking to work with here. Right?
classname … open brace … zero or more of methods/constructors/properties one after the other … close brace.

Hey, I had this problem too for a really long time and it was driving my bonkers.
I would try getting rid of the “public” key word and then double check to see whether or not your method is accidentally nested inside another method; that’s what my problem was, I couldn’t figure it out till I realized that I had forgotten to get out of the “SwitchCase()” in order to write the “TranslateToNumber();”
the static local functions refers to the functions being nested, theres more information here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/static-local-functions#:~:text=A%20static%20local%20function%20definition,the%20enclosing%20static%20local%20function.
hopefully it helps 
the error looked like this

Hello @ajax2872111171, welcome to the forums!



 ajax2872111171:

Console.Read();


What does this do? Should this be on its  own line, or should you set a variable equal to this? Also consider using Console.ReadLine() instead, as it will read the whole line, not just the first character. Here is a good article on the difference.
I hope this helps!

7,App interfaces Extend the Password property in PasswordManager,"Get Help,Git",classes-objects,2,"
Hi,
I am at the last step in the App interfaces challenge.
I got a strange Exception:
Process is terminating due to StackOverflowException.

I cannot to understand this error.


My code is here...

namespace SavingInterface
{
  class PasswordManager : IDisplayable, IResetable 
  {
    // fields:
    string password;
    
    // properties:
    private string Password { 
      get {
        return this.Password;
      } 
      set {
        if (value.Length >=8) {
          this.Password = value;
        }
      }
    }

    public bool Hidden
    { get; private set; }

    public char HeaderSymbol { get; }

    // constructor:
    public PasswordManager(string password, bool hidden)
    {
      Password = password;
      Hidden = hidden;
      this.HeaderSymbol = '$';
    }

    // methods:

      Console.WriteLine(""Password"");
      string result = new String(this.HeaderSymbol, 8);
      Console.WriteLine(result);

      if (String.Equals(current, this.Password)) {
        this.Password = newPassword;
        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

Hi Lendoo - the problem here is accidental recursion.
This code is calling itself:
set
 {
     if (value.Length >=8) 
  {
          this.Password = value;
  }
}

Specifically, this line is setting the Password property inside the setter for the Password property:
this.Password = value;

It looks like you already defined a backing field for this, so simply change the property code to get and set the backing field instead of the property itself, and you’ll be good to go:
 // fields:
    string password;
    
    // properties:
    private string Password { 
      get {
        return this.password;
      } 
      set {
        if (value.Length >=8) {
          this.password = value;
        }
      }
    }

Actually, this way you don’t need the “this” syntax either, although there’s no harm in it.

Bumping, hoping someone will reply.

No one at all has any idea with c#?

Hi @psmilliorn! I’m a Senior Curriculum Developer and I wrote this project. Super cool to see it be a part of your learning journey!
Your code fulfills steps 1-12. In fact it looks very similar to the solution code I originally intended 
Your output doesn’t look like the output in step 13 because you haven’t done the extensions. You’ll get the output shown in step 13 once you finish the first extension given (the one about HeaderSymbol and extending the Display() method).
Hope that helps! Happy to clarify anything if you have more questions.

Thank you for responding!  Yes that does clarify my concerns up to step 13.  I haven’t done step 13.  I know I will be needing help with it when I get back to it since I recall not grasping what it is asking.  But its been a few days so maybe it will make more sense when I revisit it.  Hopefully you will be OK with me pinging you again for step 13 if I get stuck.

Absolutely!
Normally we would have a project walkthrough video ready for you, but it’s in production now.

I’m unsure how this is meant to be implemented.  I get how to set it in IDisplayable.cs but not sure how the lesson wants to do the following.

Add a get-only property to  IDisplayable  called  HeaderSymbol . This should be used in  Display()  as a header. For example, if the header symbol is  - , then the apps should be displayed as:

Todos
--------
Eat
Sleep
Code

Password
-----------
***

Currently (if I comment out HeaderSymbol) my console looks like this.

Hey @psmilliorn sorry for the delayed response! It looks like you’re having a StackOverflowException, which may be a separate issue. Send me the Program.cs and PasswordManager.cs code and we can debug that first before getting into HeaderSymbol.

    public bool ChangePassword(string oldPass, string newPass)
    {
      return oldPass == newPass;
    }
  }
}


@psmilliorn Looks like the issue is in PasswordManager.cs. You are creating a property Password that tries to return the property Password. This creates a StackOverflowException - it’s sort of like an infinite loop but with method calls.
You’ll need to define a separate field and make the property Password set and get that field.

OK, so I believe I have cleared that up.  I wanted to make sure that before we revisit…

Add a get-only property to  IDisplayable  called  HeaderSymbol . This should be used in  Display()  as a header. For example, if the header symbol is  - , then the apps should be displayed as:

…that the rest of step 13 is completed.

If you add more than five to-dos to the  TodoList , it throws an error! Extend the  Add()  method so that it doesn’t add any more than five items to the  Todos  array.

I’m skeptical if I did this correctly based on output in console.

image.png1366×768 118 KB


Currently a blank line is printed for each empty index in  Todos . Change  Display()  in  TodoList  so that it prints  []  instead of a blank line

Pretty sure that was done correctly.

Add a method  ChangePassword()  to  PasswordManager .

Done.

Extend the  Password  property in  PasswordManager

Unsure if this was correct.

Thank you for all your help so far 

@psmilliorn nice work so far! The short answer is: yes, you did both of those extensions in question. More detail below:

If you add more than five to-dos to the TodoList , it throws an error! Extend the Add() method so that it doesn’t add any more than five items to the Todos array.

You did this by adding the line:
if (Todos.Length <= 5)

Extend the Password property in PasswordManager

Technically you completed this too. Although, I would recommend setting password to a default value for if the input value is less than 8. This involves adding an else statement in your set method.

@nduckwiler & @psmilliorn - thanks for this discussion. It’s been really helpful.
I’m still struggling with  the HeaderExtension challenge. I’ve been tying myself in knots with it. Can you help at all?
Cheers!

Since these post I went back some time after and did a refactor.  That part you mention was a part I also struggled with.  Until the refactor I could not get it to appear how you see it in the lesson.  Since then I can now get it to work.

From Program.cs
namespace SavingInterface

  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      TodoList tdl = new TodoList();
      PasswordManager pm = new PasswordManager(""iluvpie"", false);

      tdl.Add(""Test"");

      //Call Display() on tdl and pm. Run the program with:
      tdl.Display();
      pm.Display();

      //In Program.cs, call Reset() and Display() with tdl and pm. 
      //In other words, both objects should display, then reset, then display again.
      tdl.Reset();
      pm.Reset();
    }
  }
}

I can’t quite explain this well enough without showing examples so I’ll just show the relevant part I think your referencing.  This is taken from PasswordManager.cs
namespace SavingInterface
{
  class PasswordManager : IDisplayable, IResetable
  {

    public string HeaderSymbol => ""-----------"";
  }
}

That’s not verbatim, but again an example take from there.  HeaderSymbol is referenced in two places in my code.
        public void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Todos"");
            Console.WriteLine(HeaderSymbol);

            foreach (String s in ToDo)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(s);
            }

            Console.WriteLine(HeaderSymbol);
        }

Display() is found in todoLists.cs I also have
 public string HeaderSymbol => ""-----------"";

In TodoLists.cs an I am not sure why.  Its found since of
class TodoList : IDisplayable, IResetable


Anyhow, hope this help.s

Hello, I was wondering if either of you tested the Add() extension that was mentioned?  Did it work when you did?  I used the same “if (Todos.Length <= 5)” and then added six total Todo items and still got the same error message.  I realized that the array will always be length 5 because that’s what we defined it as in the constructor.  So it may have empty spots but it’s still length of 5.  I resolved this issue by using this in my if statement instead:  if (nextOpenIndex < 5).
Was that the intended resolution?

using System;

namespace SavingInterface
{
  class TodoList : IDisplayable, IResetable
  {
    public string[] Todos { get; private set; }

    private int nextOpenIndex;

    public TodoList()
    {
      Todos = new string[5];
      nextOpenIndex = 0;
    }

    public void Add(string todo)
    {
      if (Todos.Length <= 5)
      {
        Todos[nextOpenIndex] = todo;
        nextOpenIndex++;
      }
    }
    //Define a method that satisfies the interface requirements
    public void Display()
    {
      foreach (string s in Todos)
      {
        if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(s))
        {
          //prints [] instead of a blank line.
          Console.WriteLine(""[]"");
        }
        else 
        {
          Console.WriteLine(s);
        }
      }
    }
    //Define a method to satisfy the interface.
    public void Reset()
    {
      Todos = new string[5];
      nextOpenIndex = 0;    
    }
  }
}

I have since refactored this and use List but what I had that at the time worked was this.

Hello Nick,
In the extending of the Password property, I have the set like this:
set
{
if (value.Length > 7)
{ password = value;} else
{ password = “password”;}
}
This seems to have stopped the ChangePassword() method from working even if I am passing it a string of nine characters.  If I write the value.Length to the console it shows as zero.  Do you know what is going on there?

Hey @adamstackhouse203307,
Your set method looks okay. There might be a problem with the rest of your Password class. Could you paste in the entire Password.cs file?

Tools.cs is a file in that project that you can look at

How do you like at files inside of a project on the tutorials page?
I understand where to look in C# IDE’s but where do you go to find them on here.

Hello, @blog5126251307, and welcome to the forums.
In the bash console on the right where you type dotnet run, you can enter the command ls. You’ll see Tools.cs listed as one of the files. If you’d like to view the contents of the file, you can execute
cat Tools.cs.
The Contains() method belongs to the Tools class.

Not to mention that you can create and run c# programs to do whatever you want, including displaying a file.
But yeah, considering that there already exists several programs with that capability, use one of those instead: cat less more vi grep nano tail head sed, being some, and there are several language runtimes/compilers installed like perl, python, c, c++, nodejs … or one can get creative and send it over the internet with curl or any of the aforementioned languages, so you could for instance send it to a pastebin service

Try to adding writeLine statements at every point you make a calculation to make sure it’s what you want. Remember that division and rounding can have strange effects.

Hi,
A bit later I found why is my result is different.
The author computed the circle area with radius = 375, but I computed with 375 / 2.
On the sketch 375 is the diameter.
Maybe anyone have to correct the solution at point 10…

Actually - 375 is the radius of the circle, if you look at the drawing - you’re right to divide the full area by 2 to make it half circle, but the radius of the half circle is still the full 375.

Hello @adis_1102. Unfortunately we can’t give answers on the forum, but if you post your code, or ask specific question, we can help.

Ok…thanks for the answer. I ll try again and come back with a more specific answer.

Hello,
So I went through the information I have so far from this class and tried something, which doesnt work BUT, I have as requested some more specific questions.
Here we go:
using System;

namespace ArchitectArithmetic
{
  class Program
  {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
     totalArea(2,3,3,4,5);
    }


    static double rect2(double length, double width)
    {
      return length*width;
    }

    static double circle2(double radius)
    {
      return 0.5*Math.PI*Math.Pow(radius,2);
    }

    static double triangle2(double bottom, double height)
    {
      return 0.5*bottom*height;
    }

   static double totalArea(double area1,double area2,double area3)
    {
      double area1=rect2();
      double area2=circle2();
      double area3=triangle2();
      return area1+area2+area3;
    }
 
  }
}

Here is what I thought how I can solve that:


Define the shapes (this should be saved as “rect2”, “circle2” and “triangle2”


sum them up ( I am stuck here…)
My try was


    static double totalArea(double area1,double area2,double area3)
    {
      double area1=rect2();
      double area2=circle2();
      double area3=triangle2();
      return area1+area2+area3;

    }

So how do I sum up the results from method rect2, circle2 and triangl2?
Where do I need to put in the values (e.g. lenght, width, radius), already in the definition
double area1=rect2();

or in the output at the top Main()?
Thanks in advance,

Hi,
Thanks for sharing your code! There’s quite a few things going on so I’ll try to break it down. Before I do so, I highly recommend sketching on paper a “map” of your code, to better visualize how the information is going to travel.
Beginning
You call the function totalArea() with 5 parameters as input (2, 3, 3, 4, 5). This means that your function has to be able to take that many in (currently, it only takes 3). That’s what the first error message hints at

No overload for method ‘totalArea’ takes 5 arguments

public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
     totalArea(2,3,3,4,5);
    }

Middle
So now it’s important to think what information the totalArea() needs to calculate these areas, so I would name them things like double rectHeight, double rectLength (etc). But to be clear, you need all the values that would calculate the areas for you.
Then when you call rect2(), you can call it like so: double area1 = rect2(rectHeight, rectLength); and you will get your desired value.
End
Going back to the main function, totalArea(2,3,3,4,5); will return the value of the sum of the areas. It will not print them to the terminal/console. So if you want to see what that value is, you need to print it explicitly. In general, it is good practice when you’re starting out to add print statements in places where you are doing operations on variables to make sure the desired effects are happening. It’ll catch errors way before the program becomes too big, which is useful whether you’re a beginner or advanced!
Edit: the better question to ask if you already have functions that do this for you and can work in this line for you…
I hope this clarifies some of the ideas! Sharing issues is a great way to get better at coding!

Hi,
First of all, thanks for your advice. It didn’t help me directly, however, it brought up some ideas(I guess it was itented…otherwise you would have posted the code 
I rewrote the code and implemented it in a different way. It works, BUT I am not satisfied…
The definition of “CalculateTotalCosts” is now:
    static double CalculateTotalCost(double area1Lenght, double area1Heigt,double area2Radius,double area3Bottom,double area3Height)
    {
     double CalculateTotalCost=(area1Lenght*area1Heigt+0.5*Math.PI*Math.Pow(area2Radius,2)+0.5*area3Bottom*area3Height)*180;
     Console.WriteLine(Math.Round(CalculateTotalCost,2));
     return CalculateTotalCost;
    }

the output in Main() is:
CalculateTotalCost(4,5,4,10,9);


$ dotnet run
16223.89

The reason I changed the code was the following:
If I follow my first attempt and also what you suggested:

double area1 = rect2(rectHeight, rectLength)

then I need to put in a value for “area1”, however, I need to put in 2 values, one for the height and one for the length…how do I do that in Main()?
the same issues occurs in my new code…I would rather separate shapes, instead of putting em together in one line of code…but I encounter the same issue as above…
Any suggestions or hints?

Well, you already went to the trouble of writing methods for shapes, like you said!
You can probably do totalArea(rect2(*enter paramaters*),circle2(*enter paramaters*), triangle2(*enter paramaters*)); and have the totalArea() just sum these like you had originally. It really depends on what you want your functions to do and what would be the most logical way.
Then totalArea() would look like this:
static double totalArea(double area1,double area2,double area3)
    {
 
      return area1+area2+area3;

    }

Your intuition is right to avoid lines like: double CalculateTotalCost=(area1Lenght*area1Heigt+0.5*Math.PI*Math.Pow(area2Radius,2)+0.5*area3Bottom*area3Height)*180;. There’s usually an easier way for you to do it! The act of looking for it is an important muscle for programmers to develop.

Hi,
Thanks for your help again, it helped me a lot.
Though I used it, however, it didnt come to my mind to use methods inside a method…



 toastedpitabread:

totalArea(rect2(enter paramaters),circle2(enter paramaters), triangle2(enter paramaters));


I have an issue putting “Console.WriteLine()” into the method…so that you dont have to use it in the “Main()” area.
I found actually two solutions (more or less), one I prefer but dont understand and another I understand but doesnt seem to be clear as a code, so I dont wanna use it.
The first part is now:
using System;

namespace ArchitectArithmetic
{
  class Program
  {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
    CalculateTotalCost(rect2(4,5),circle2(4),triangle2(10,9));
    }

    static double rect2(double length, double width)
    {
      return length*width;
    }

    static double circle2(double radius)
    {
      return 0.5*Math.PI*Math.Pow(radius,2);
    }

    static double triangle2(double bottom, double height)
    {
      return 0.5*bottom*height;
    }

The second part is:
Solution 1:
static void CalculateTotalCost(double areaRect, double areaCircle, double areaTriangle)

    {
    Console.WriteLine((areaRect+areaCircle+areaTriangle)*180);  
    }

This one uses “void” as a return parameter, however, I am not sure if there isnt a better way instead of calculating inside of ""Console.WriteLine().
“Solution” 2:
    static double CalculateTotalCost(double areaRect, double areaCircle, double areaTriangle)

    { 

    Console.WriteLine((areaRect+areaCircle+areaTriangle)*180);  
    return areaRect+areaCircle+areaTriangle;
    }

So here the costs will be printed to the console, while the return is just the area without any costs
My questions are:
-May you suggest any solution where I can print the “return” to the console? I tried combining them but nothing worked.



 adis_1102:

     Console.WriteLine(Math.Round(CalculateTotalCost,2));
     return CalculateTotalCost;

Also my previous code part didnt work, cause the result is differently implemented…


-I dont see any difference here between using “static void” and using “static double…” with the ""return parameter…In general I didnt really understood the difference…
Thanks in advance, Adis

Hello @adis_1102.



 adis_1102:

I have an issue putting “Console.WriteLine()” into the method…so that you dont have to use it in the “Main()” area.


This is generally discouraged(as the data from the function is not useable in any other code); however, in your case it’s fine.



 adis_1102:

calculating inside of ""Console.WriteLine().


This is completely fine, but if you wanted, you could store the computation in a variable:
double x =5*5; //computation
Console.WriteLine(x);




 adis_1102:

So here the costs will be printed to the console, while the return is just the area without any costs


Do you want to return anything? Are you going to use this data later, or are you just returning it to fill the function return type?



 adis_1102:

I tried combining them but nothing worked.


You could have two Console.WriteLine(), but you probably though of that. You could also create an array of the two computations, and access them by index:
int comp_1 = 5*5;
int comp_2 = 5*7;
int[] comps = {comp_1, comp2}
Console.WriteLine($""{comps[0]}, {comps[1]}"");//formatted how you like

(Sorry if I mis-understood what you meant!)



 adis_1102:

In general I didnt really understood the difference…


The return parameter/type of a function is the data type it will return. They  basically tell the program to expect a certain type to be returned, and to throw an error if the wrong type is returned. These are the same as the datatypes you use when declaring variables: int, double, string, etc-with one exception: void. void indicates that there will be nothing returned from the function.
I hope this helps!

Hi everyone,
Attached I d like to share my solution to this case. I am open and thankful for improvements.
Thanks a lot to @toastedpitabread and @codeneutrino for supporting me in this case.
using System;

namespace ArchitectArithmetic
{
  class Program
  {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      CalculateTotalCosts(rect2(4,5),circle2(4),triangle2(10,9));
    }


    static double rect2(double length, double width)
    {
      return length*width;
    }

    static double circle2(double radius)
    {
      return 0.5*Math.PI*Math.Pow(radius,2);
    }

    static double triangle2(double bottom, double height)
    {
      return 0.5*bottom*height;
    }

    static void CalculateTotalCosts(double areaRect, double areaCircle, double areaTriangle)
    { 
       Console.WriteLine($""{Math.Round((areaRect+areaCircle+areaTriangle)*180,2)} Pesos"");  
    }

  }
}

The output:

16223.89 Pesos

Hi! Welcome to the forums.
“!” is a negation. Or, it inverts your condition.
Here, startGame = false, then !startGame would be the opposite, or, True.

You are missing adding 1 point to each password entered due to the line mentioned above. Happy Coding!

Thanks for reminding me to change it.

Why is it “if score >=  minLength” and not “password.length >= minLength”? That’s what I used my first time through, and it works. The highest score you can get using score >= minLength is 4, how can that statement ever return true? Maybe I’m having a giant noob moment here but that doesn’t make sense to me.

Hello @jbendz. Welcome to the forum.
if (password.Length >= minLength)
{
  score++;
} 

Not sure why you’re asking, but you are correct. It should be as you stated, and I’ve re-illustrated above. There is no need to check if score > minLength.

I have finished this exercise but need some help with regular expressions(Regex); I am not sure how to change a code, for example:
if (!Tools.Contains(password, upperCase))
{
Console.WriteLine(“Password does not contain an uppercase letter, INSECURE!”);
}
into another code that uses Regex to check for password.
Btw, side question is: What is tools.contain? is this “tools” a method that is only built in CodeAcademy program? Or it can be called up using System in visual studio?
Thank you!
If my question is not clear, please write responses tell me so. I will make it more clear.

Thanks, and I was asking because in example two posts above me it was shown as score >= minLength. I came to the forum for entirely different reason, but when I saw that it confused me and I thought I might be missing something. Thank you for the response.

Oh. Yeah, that wasn’t an example of what to do. It was code that needed fixing 

I am using an online compiler and when I try to compile the source code it gives me the following error. A word of notice here, the program runs fine in codecademy panel.

Hello, @madaskalas.
Tools.cs is a separate file included in the exercise. In the Codecademy environment you can see the file by typing ls in the console. If you want to see the code, you can type cat Tools.cs. Tools.Contains is a quite simple method, that you could duplicate into your own code that you are using outside of the CC environment.

Thanks, @midlindner,
Tools.cs should be a separate file, correct? Here is the URL of the project. For some reason, it throws the same error. Can you give me some information about Tools.Contains ? I searched the web, but I only found the String.Contains Method.




 madaskalas:

Tools.cs should be a separate file, correct?


doesn’t have to be, you could integrate this function into your class, does mean you have to make some small changes.
the codecademy project also has PasswordChecker.csproj file, maybe that is what integrate the two cs files? Some sort of project structure file? Not sure, i barely done any C#

There are a couple of ways you could incorporate the Contains method from Tools.cs
Since you already created the Tools.cs file in your project, you could just wrap your MainClass in the same namespace that the Tools class is in like so:
using System;

namespace PasswordChecker 
{
  class MainClass 
  {
    public static void Main (string[] args) 
    {
     //Main method code
    }
  }
}

Or, you could add the Contains method to your mainClass like so:
class MainClass 
{
  public static void Main (string[] args)
  {
  //Main method code
  //Instead of Tools.Contains(arg1, arg2) you would simply use Contains(arg1, arg2)
  }
  //Add the Contains method here after the Main method, but still inside the MainClass class
  public static bool Contains(string target, string list)
    {
      return target.IndexOfAny(list.ToCharArray()) != -1;
    }
}

Using the second option, you could delete the Tools.cs file from your Repl.

Works great, Thank you!

You’ve specefied a return type, but the method lacks a return statement. Hence:

Beyond that, there are a few more issues, but see what you can do after figuring out what you want to return.

Thanks for quick reply! I solved the problem right after I posted on forums…
But if you could point me to my other mistakes in this code, please do so, I would appreciate. I know this code is very basic and not really organized, but it’s a start!

The JSON response to the above is:
 



You can see the first hit is Mortal Kombat II and the second is the one I am looking for, the original Mortal Kombat. So from the code above I get 2 main things I need in order to search “deeper”. The Game ID and the Platforms ID(s). But with saying that - there lye’s the problem. I am unable to just search for Mortal Kombat and automatically get the correct 1992 version.
So without knowing the date that a game came out how can I search for the correct game with the needed platform of SNES?
UPDATE 1
So I tried doing the following:
    using (
        var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(""games/?search="" + 
                       HttpUtility.UrlEncode(""mortal kombat"") + 
                       ""&fields=name,platforms.name&where platforms.id = 19"")

But I always end up with the same data no matter what:
      {
        ""id"": 81899,
        ""name"": ""Mortal Kombat \u0026 Mortal Kombat II"",
        ""platforms"": [

19,Changing the value of a double,"Get Help,Git","data-types-variables,general",6,"
Hi, I’m back already. I’m creating a change machine that organizes the amount of change a person inputs into quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Google doesn’t seem to understand what I’m saying so hopefully, you can help.  After I found the number of quarters I tried to change the value of the original change amount. How can I make this work?
string change = Console.ReadLine();
double changeMoney = Convert.ToDouble(change);
double quarterNumber = Math.Floor(changeMoney / quarterMoney);
Console.WriteLine($“You have {quarterNumber} quarters!”);
double changeMoney = changeMoney - (quarterMoney * quarterNumber);
","
Do you have more code than what you’ve posted?
(Aside, please review How do I format code in my posts?)
As is your code will throw an error first for trying to declare double changeMoney on line 5 after having already declared it on line 2. Also for referencing quarterMoney on line 3 without having defined it previously.

Yes, sorry I was rushing to get the question out so I could see the responses later.
I want to be able to re-define double changeMoney so I don’t have to write a new variable each time. Idk if that would work or not but if there’s an easier way I would be happy to hear it.
This is the full code:
using System;

namespace Review
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
    double quarterMoney = 0.25;
    double dimeMoney = 0.10;
    double nickelMoney = 0.05;
    double pennyMoney = 0.01;
    Console.WriteLine(""Tell me how much change you have and I will split it into quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies! Ex: 1.53"");
    string change = Console.ReadLine();
    double changeMoney = Convert.ToDouble(change);
    double quarterNumber = Math.Floor(changeMoney / quarterMoney);
    Console.WriteLine($""You have {quarterNumber} quarters!"");
    double changeMoney = changeMoney - (quarterMoney * quarterNumber);
    }
  }
}

I want to be able to subtract the value of the quarters from the original amount so that it can find the number of dimes, nickels, and pennies.

I’m having the urge to point out that you’re counting cents, which can be represented as integer. You have no need for double and may even get unexpected results. In particular, double is not for representing decimal values, it is not for representing numbers you see in grade school.
Numbers used in grade school behave more like strings - because you can write them on paper. Double does not necessarily represent them exactly because it is not a string, it uses a different scheme for representation.
Arguably you should be doing this:
int quarter = 25
int dime = 10
int nickel = 5
int penny = 1
int dollar = 100

Or perhaps you would use fractions.
This, for example:



 firetire1:

Math.Floor(changeMoney / quarterMoney);



Could result in 1 too few if you had a result of 5.999999999999999999999999.
You’d be better off rounding, because then it would snap back to what you meant, but you’d still have to dodge lots of pitfalls as a result of using a representation that isn’t what you mean it to be.

Ah, makes much more “cents” now, thank you. Sorry, bad pun. I’m just trying to figure out if there is a better way to do this than assign a new variable every time I want to find the amount of change left. Sorry if this doesn’t make sense, explaining is not one of my strong suits. I now realize that it would take probably longer to re-define the variable but is there a better way to do this?
using System;

namespace Review
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
    int quarterMoney = 25;
    int dimeMoney = 10;
    int nickelMoney = 5;
    int pennyMoney = 1;
    Console.WriteLine(""Tell me how much change you have and I will split it into quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies! Ex: 153 cents = 5 quarters, 0 dimes, 0 nickels, and 3 pennies!"");
    int userInput = Int32.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    int quarterNumber = userInput / quarterMoney;
    int leftoverChange1 = userInput - (quarterNumber * quarterMoney);
    int dimeNumber = leftoverChange1 / dimeMoney;
    int leftoverChange2 = leftoverChange1 - (dimeNumber * dimeMoney);
    int nickelNumber = leftoverChange2 / nickelMoney;
    int pennyNumber = leftoverChange2 - (nickelNumber * nickelMoney);
    string splitChange = $""{userInput} cents = {quarterNumber} quarters, {dimeNumber} dimes, {nickelNumber} nickels, and {pennyNumber} pennies!"";
    Console.WriteLine(splitChange);
    
    
    }
  }
}



Well yeah but I figured you’d find out through googling or looking at other code.

Hi, I’m really new to C# and I’m trying to figure out how to convert a string to an integer. I’m trying to make a number guesser where you guess a number 1-10 and it tells you if you guessed too low or high or whatever.  I don’t know how to show the code so I’m just gonna copy and paste it. Don’t mind the Convert.ToInt I was just desperate and trying to figure it out. If anything else is wrong I would appreciate help with that too.
Console.WriteLine(“Hey! Pick a number 1-10!”);
string guess = Console.ReadLine();
int answer = 5;
int number = Convert.ToInt(guess);
bool tooLow = guess < answer;

21,/ cannot be applied to rand of type 'string' and 'int',"Get Help,Git",general,5,"
Hi,
I am new to the community and getting stuck on the following:
For an exercise I need to provide a few things, it will be an coin converter

To find the maximum number of gold coins that “fit” into the amount (e.g. one gold coin fits into 11 cents):


Divide the amount by the value of a gold coin
Round down to the nearest integer
Store the result in a double variable called goldCoins

But continuously I got the error ""Operator ‘/’ cannot be applied to rands of type ‘string’ and ‘int’""
The code I have;
using System;

namespace MoneyMaker
{
  class MainClass
  {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      int gold = 10;
      int silver = 5;

      Console.WriteLine(""Welcome to Money Maker!"");

      Console.WriteLine(""Enter an amount to convert to coins:"");
      string userInput = Console.ReadLine();
      double userInputConvert = Convert.ToDouble(userInput);
      Console.WriteLine($""{userInput} cents is equal to ..."");

      double goldCoins = Math.Floor(userInput / gold);
      
    }
  }
}

The error causes because of the last line of code;
double goldCoins = Math.Floor(userInput / gold);

If I change the variables in the () to numbers it will work, but this needs to calculate from the user input. That is why I think there should be a dividing between variables.
","
The error is pretty helpful? the division operator (/) can not be applied to rands of type string (userInput) and int (gold)
i mean, you convert the user input to a double, but you don’t end up using this double when doing the calculation.

Hi stetim94,
You are right about the error which is very helpful, but I didn’t quite understand it.
But what you’ve mentioned (you convert the user input to a double, but you don’t end up using this double when doing the calculation), made me thinking in the right direction.
The line of code which I had to change was:
      double goldCoins = Math.Floor(userInputConvert/ gold);

Thanks for your help!
Kind regards,
Oguzhan Kevek

Next time, you could look at the error, print the variable and types used in the division. These kind of steps can help you at getting better with handling errors.

that certainly gave me a clearer picture, putting variable names in the errors.
Thanks!

23,App Interfaces - Todos array,"Get Help,Git","classes-objects,arrays-loops,general",2,"
Hello,
I have a question related to point no 13 in project called “App Interfaces”.  One of the additional points is:
"" If you add more than five to-dos to the TodoList , it throws an error! Extend the Add() method so that it doesn’t add any more than five items to the Todos array.""
I added validation to the Add method so that it is not possible to add more than five items:
    public void Add(string todo)
    {
      if(Todos.Length < 5)
      {
        Todos[nextOpenIndex] = todo;
        nextOpenIndex++;
      }
    }

And after that I’m calling this function 7 times with these arguments:
      tdl.Add(""Invite friends"");
      tdl.Add(""Buy decorations"");
      tdl.Add(""Party"");
      tdl.Add(""Invite friends"");
      tdl.Add(""Party"");
      tdl.Add(""Task 6"");
      tdl.Add(""Task 7"");
      tdl.Display();

However, after calling this function, an empty list is displayed, containing no items that should be in the list as if the list already contained the maximum number of items, but it was declared as an empty list.
Todos = new string[5];


What should I do to ensure that the method displays the added items correctly?
Thank you for respond, if needed, I can put the whole application code here.
","
Ok, I figured it out myself
“Extending TodoList.Add(): To extend the Add() method, use an if-else statement that checks if the Todos.Length is less than 5.”
Todos.Length should be replaced by “nextOpenIndex”, because declaring the list in this way: Todos = new string[5]; the if condition I mentioned before will always evaluate to false and no values ​​will be added to the list.

25,Is (y == 7) really the opposite of (y != 7)? Observing random variables,"Get Help,Git","logic-conditionals,general",7,"
I wrote a program that keeps generating random numbers between 0 and 10,000 until the number generated is equal to a predetermined value (in this case 4377). Then the program repeats the process for N number of times, then calculates the average number of tries it takes the computer to get 4377.
I have done this the first time using an infinite while loop with an if statement inside it that breaks out of the loop when the number is equal to 4377, then I thought my code had a redundant line (the if statement), I could just write (y != 4377) as a while condition. .
Contrary to my expectations, I got different results for each case. The first code usually takes around 10,000 tries on average (consistently) to get 4377, when the second code takes way fewer tries on average, some times as few as 3! That’s a huge difference! (N = 1000).

If you start with 4377 you’ll need zero guesses

That’s true (1 guess) but very unlikely. That’s why I’m obtaining the mean of guesses of 1000 tries.

No, zero.
You’re starting with 4377, so you make zero rerolls.

It’s impossible to start with 4377 because y is set to 0 at the start of the code.

after setting y to 0, you set it to 4377
you asked why your mean is too low. this is why.

That is true. I should’ve reset y before starting the guessing loop again. Thank you.

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-dating-profile
Having an issue with step 12, checking to see if hobbies array is greater than 0 in an if statement:
 public string ViewProfile()
        {   string profileInfo = 
            $""{name}. From {city}, {country}. Is {age} years old. {pronouns}."";
          if (hobbies.Length > 0)
         {
            profileInfo = profileInfo + "" Likes: "";
            foreach (string hobby in hobbies)
            {
              profileInfo = profileInfo + hobby + "", "";
            }
          }
          return profileInfo;
       }

I can comment out the if statement and it works. The error I’m getting is “unhandled exception object reference not set to an instance of an object”. I read up on it and it said the error may occur if the data is set to null. In the constructor, I have
string[] hobbies = new string[0];
Again, this works, so long as I don’t have an if statement. I’ve tried referencing the length of hobbies with the this keyword, and I get the same error.

Hi there, welcome to the forums!
I’m guessing that your issue is that hobbies is not defined in that scope…
Do you have a hobbies variable declared elsewhere? I think you probably do. In which case, are you sure you’re referencing it correctly?
Hint: You’re working inside a class… what’s the correct way to reference a class attribute from inside the object created by the class? 

I had it declared as a field and in the constructor with and without this keyword and set it to length [0] in the constructor both ways, but I didn’t have it as a parameter. I didn’t think to try it as a parameter.
The text of the project gives the idea that you have to set the length to [0] and then run an if statement to see the length. I think the problem was unless the values are actually set within the array, it didn’t like trying to figure out if the length of null was greater than 0.

What I ended up doing is just added a field for the profile string, handed the string over to the constructor so that a “profile” was built for each Profile object, and handed the foreach loop to SetHobbies(). The field could then be called from ViewProfile(). This solution makes setting hobbies optional and just adds them onto the string when and only when SetHobbies() is called.


Hi, I think



 digitalninja77067:

string hobbies = new string[0];


is wrong in the constructor. This way you initialise a new string.
I managed to run the code by setting the existing field
private string hobbies;
to
hobbies = new string[0];
in the constructor. This way I set the field to an empty array.
Then in the SetHobbies() method i set the field hobbies to the array I initialise with the method:
this.hobbies = hobbies
and in the ViewProfile() method I check if this array is longer than 0:
if (this.hobbies.Length > 0)
Here is my entire code for the Profile class:

hello, im doing this exercise right now and was stuck on the same thing.
what i changed when stuck at step 10
using System;

namespace TrueOrFalse
{
  class Program
  {
		static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // Do not edit these lines
      Console.WriteLine(""Welcome to 'True or False?'\nPress any key to begin:"");
      string entry = Console.ReadLine();
      Tools.SetUpInputStream(entry);

      // Type your code below
      //string array of questions
      string[] questions = new string[] { ""is shaen alpha? "", ""is yul a trash silver?"", ""is guillaume plat on tft? "" };
      //bool array of answers to question[]
      bool[] answers = new bool[] { false, false, true };
      //bool array of responses user write
      bool[] responses = new bool[questions.Length];
      
      //warning if too much answers compared to questions
      if (questions.Length != answers.Length)
      {
        Console.WriteLine(""the number of answers doesn't match the number of answers, retry"");
      }
      
      int askingIndex = 0;
      
      foreach (string question in questions)
      {
        string input;
        bool isBool;
        bool inputBool;
        
        Console.WriteLine(question, ""true or false?"");
        input = Console.ReadLine();
        
        isBool = Boolean.TryParse(input, out inputBool);
      }
      
      
      
    }
  }
}

when you’re in your foreach loop and you need to print your questions from questions array. You build your loop saying “for each QUESTION in questions”.  question is string type, that means that foreach will look for string values in your questions array. Everytime foreach find a string in questions, it will print it to the console.
Thats why you just need Console.WriteLine(question, “true or false?”);  when you want to print each question one after another.
You might already found the answer yourself but maybe it will help someone else. Also im a total noob to coding so this is how i understand it, but  if anyone has a better explanation and/or  way to do it i’ll be glad to read it !

Leave one kind of solution here for this exercise.

      bool [] responses = new bool [questions.Length];

        }

Not exactly sure what you are trying to do with this function, but it has a few issues. You cannot have a return statement in a function declared with void. void means that there will be no return type. Your switch block returns int's, so you probably want static int TranslateToNumber(string creature).
Next problem is the last 3 lines of the function. You cannot declare an int variable, and assign a string to it. It’s important to note, however, that those 3 lines will never be executed. Your switch block contains the keyword return in every case, so control will be passed back to the line of code that called the function immediately with the return value once a return is reached.

What exactly should the code be then

I haven’t done this project myself, but to clear your error, you just need to change void to int, and delete the 3 lines assigning strings to int variables. If those variables are required for the project, they belong somewhere else. I briefly looked at the instructions, and the only thing this function is supposed to do is return an int that is determined by the string creature you pass to the function.

Do you know anyone that has?

No. I don’t. If you continue to post your code as you have questions or errors, I’ll help you, but even if I had done this project, I wouldn’t just give you the solution. Finding and fixing errors is a great learning experience. I haven’t completed the C# course here on Codecademy, but I learned C# years ago through another resource, and have a fair amount of experience in the language. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask, but most of us on the forum won’t just provide entire solutions. Good luck, and keep at it!

Okay. Now I have completed the project, and as I stated before, you can’t return anything from a method declared with void. That is what is giving you the error regarding converting void to int. The declaration of the TranslateToNumber() method should include the data type that the method will return. You are returning either 1, 2 or 3, so it should be declared as follows:
static int TranslateToNumber(string creature)

Your switch block is perfectly fine, but the 3 lines below it do not belong in the TranslateToNumber() method. They will be declared in the BuildACreature() method and assigned values using the TranslateToNumber() method. (See steps 17 & 18).
Good luck && Happy coding! Feel free to post your code, and ask additional questions if you need more help.

Okay I got that done but in the last couple of steps I don’t get why it isn’t printing out a creature when I put in the command.

}

Okay. Your SwitchCase() method should only accept 3 parameters not 6. Should only accept (int head, int body, int feet).
If you read instruction #13 carefully, you’ll see that you are supposed to call the SwitchCase() method at the end of the RandomMode() method.

13.
Now, return to the RandomMode() method. Call the SwitchCase() method after the int variable definitions.
Make sure to pass in the variables head , body , and feet as arguments to the SwitchCase() method. That way, each time we run the program, a new set of numbers will be passed to that method and the output will change.

Those changes will make your program work. I was a little disappointed that the project doesn’t include instructions for actually using the BuildACreature() method. You can use it, by calling SwitchCase() as the last line inside the method, and passing (headNum, bodyNum, feetNum) as arguments. Then you also need to add a call to BuildACreature() inside the Main() method. When you do, you have to select which parts you want like so:
BuildACreature(""bug"", ""monster"", ""ghost"");

That would give you a bug head, monster body and ghost feet.
Good luck! You’re almost there!

Hi
I do not understand what they want from me in 19.
19.
Pass the new  int  variables into the  SwitchCase()  method as arguments. Congratulations, you just refactored your code using methods!
static void SwitchCase(int head, int body, int feet)
        {
            switch (head)
            {
                case 1:
                    BugHead();
                    break;
                case 2:
                    GhostHead();
                    break;
                case 3:
                    MonsterHead();
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }

            switch (body)
            {
                case 1:
                    BugBody();
                    break;
                case 2:
                    GhostBody();
                    break;
                case 3:
                    MonsterBody();
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }

            switch (feet)
            {
                case 1:
                    BugFeet();
                    Console.WriteLine(""\n"");
                    break;
                case 2:
                    GhostFeet();
                    Console.WriteLine(""\n"");
                    break;
                case 3:
                    MonsterFeet();
                    Console.WriteLine(""\n"");
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }

        }

I thought I understood the whole project until this line 19 threw me off.
I now have an app that has a method BuildACreature, SwitchCase, TranslateToNumber and RandomMode.
But I am not exactly sure what I built in a sense. If I call RandomMode and run it, it works really nicely.
static void RandomMode()
        {
            Random randomNumber = new Random();
            int head = randomNumber.Next(1, 4);
            int body = randomNumber.Next(1, 4);
            int feet = randomNumber.Next(1, 4);

            SwitchCase(head, body, feet);
        }

If I call TranslateToNumber(“bug”); - or anything, it does nothing.
static int TranslateToNumber(string creature)
        {
            switch (creature)
            {
                case ""bug"":
                    return 1;
                case ""ghost"":
                    return 2;
                case ""monster"":
                    return 3;
                default:
                    return 1;
            }
        }

If I call SwitchCase it works nicely.
So what exactly was the purpose of the last few steps? You are able to call string to int and the other way around  - I think?
What about it? How does it help me?
Does this mean I can tell my user to write 1, 2, 3 or bug, monster, ghost and either way is intended to print out a result?
Thanks in advance…

Hello, @real_arbitrary.
From what I can see, and what you’ve described, it looks like you’ve done a great job building what was expected. From what I recall, having done this project some time ago, step 19 is a step allowing for random generation of a ‘corpse’ using the RandomMode() method. You can randomly generate numbers, and then the SwitchCase method converts the numbers to the corresponding parts.



 real_arbitrary:

I suppose that’s up to you. You just have to make sure that you supply the correct arguments to the correct methods. I just went to the project to see, and it appears that in this environment, you could actually write code to get user input (not all of the lessons/projects have a console pane that will allow user input), and then use that input to determine whether to call RandomMode(), or to generate a specific ‘corpse’ like ‘bug’, or you could even allow the user to choose which creature’s parts are assigned to each section (head, body, feet). These features would be beyond the scope of the project, but could be fun to implement.
I’m not sure I answered your questions. The project shows how to use some of the things you’ve learned so far, and isn’t necessarily a good ‘real world’ example of a useful program. You, as the programmer, however, are free to build on this project, and make it as useful or interactive as you like. Taking the lessons and projects a step or two beyond what is expected (after passing the required steps) is a great way to learn.

Thanks for your reply.
Your input was valuable. I went back to this now and watched the video where the pro programmer was working.
I found that my app is the same as what he did, yet when I run my BuildACreature(“monster”, “bug”, “ghost”); my TransLateToNumber(): always returns the default of 1.
I took the liberty of putting the app I am working on on Github (if you execute number 4 it launches the code for Exquisite Corpse) - My app on GitHub here
Can anyone please help me out?

What input do you give your TranslateToNumber method? What does TranslateToNumber do with that input? Based on the code in that method, what would you need to enter to for example get 2?

So I call BuildACreature here:

image707×468 22.6 KB

Inside BuildACreature:

And then TransLateToNumber:

Overview:

image629×611 16.5 KB

What input do you give your TranslateToNumber method? What does TranslateToNumber do with that input? Based on the code in that method, what would you need to enter to for example get 2?
-> I give TransLateToNumber a string
-> TransLateToNumber returns an int
-> If you wanted 2 you would provide “ghost”
I keep hitting the default return thuogh.

right but, what string did you use? you’d need to use “ghost” or “monster”, otherwise what would you get?

I gave it BuildACreature(“ghost”, “monster”, “bug”);
You know? Statically to just get it working.
My idea is to let a user decide so I can make it dynamic.

That’s a different method.
You have some method that is returning something other than what you expected.
So, what input did you give it, and what output did you get, and was the input wrong, or was the response wrong?
When something’s wrong, you’d observe what happened and compare what you see to what you meant should happen, and when you have found the difference you know what to change.

When in doubt, print it out. Is the input truly what you intended? If the output is unexpected, something must not be going according to plan. To find where things change from what you expected, you can print the values before and after each step to see what is happening. For example you might try:
static int TranslateToNumber(string creature)
{
    Console.WriteLine(creature); //Does this print what you expected? If so, great, check the next thing. If not, why not? Go back to where the value came from, and continue making observations.
    switch (creature)
    {

I still have no idea though how you can code the first additional assignment:
Extend the  BuildACreature()  method so that all of its parameters are optional. It should assign a random body part if a parameter is not specified.

I keep getting this error message while doing this project but my code seems to be the same as everyone else’s. Any ideas?

29,Hi problem with exercises,"Get Help,Git","methods,quiz",4,"
Create a  KeepInBounds()  method. Without this method, hitting the boundaries will break the game!
Every time a key is pressed, it will be called twice: once for x and once for y. The method will constrain a coordinate between 0 and its maximum value to keep the character from going off-screen.
The method should:

have the  public new static  modifiers
return an  int

have two arguments: an  int  representing the coordinate, and an  int  representing the maximum value

Here’s how the method will be used. Imagine that the x-coordinate has a maximum of  10  (exclusive), so it should only take values from  0  through  9 :
// newX will be 1 newX = KeepInBounds(1, 10); // newX will be 0 newX = KeepInBounds(-1, 10); // newX will be 9 newX = KeepInBounds(10,10); // newX will be 9 newX = KeepInBounds(11,10);

I don’t know much about C#, but perhaps the issue is your void start {}. I’ve never seen such a structure before, and I always have a Main method in the main part of my program. Doesn’t VS provide you with boilerplate code already?

The thing is I don’t know much about C# either, as I started learning it about a week ago. Could you tell me what a main method would look like? Also I’m using VS Code, not VS. VS Code is a more basic editor than VS and doesn’t provide code templates.

All the lessons in C# show you the boilerplate code. Just copy one and change the names of stuff if you want. Have you finished the C# course yet? At some point in there you’ll know how to construct the Main method yourself.

OK, that makes sense, I haven’t actually completed the C# course so I might be doing something wrong. Thanks!

It sounds like you already kind of have a handle on the algorithm. If you break it down into steps, you should be able to accomplish this.
For each of the last 6 months:

Calculate the total for the first month.
Add that month’s total to the array.
Repeat 1 and 2 for each month afterwards.
Output the result.

35,C# Password Check Project -Assistance,"Get Help,Git",logic-conditionals,2,"
Hey all,
I am fairly new to the programming community, but am preparing for an upcoming MTA exam and figured out the best way to prepare for exam is to study and get ""hands-on""experience to hone in on the concepts taught. I started the C# program 2 weeks ago and am understanding fairly everything but hit my first wall in the learning path.
I am currently on the “Password Check” project where the program is designed to assess the user’s input (password) and determine its complexity using a scoring system. The problem seems to work, however the control blocks of my code are not performing as anticipated. The scoring method is granted scores when it is not supposed to. Every input i use as a proposed password give the score of “5”, regardless of complexity. based off the hint section in the project, the passwords “oooOVER-9000!” should return a score of “5”, “thatsallfolks” return a value of “2”, and ""        ""(Spaces) should return a score of “0”.  below is my code to see if anyone can help me identify where I went wrong. I refuse to look at the solution.

You have a semi-colon after the if statement but before the code block you want to be associated with the if statement.  This means that the if statement code block is empty and the score++ will always be run.

If you start over with a new dictionary every time you add something then …

Meaning I will need a loop. Which one? I can’t figured out how to start writing out my loop.

meaning that you should define it once and then never again

I’m not understanding what you pointing to. More info would gladly help.

You’re saying you don’t have as many entries in your dict as you expect.
You are repeatedly setting it to empty, so yeah, no wonder that entries are getting discarded.

Thanks I see what you talking about now. That part working now.

38,C# Conditional Statements Review Excercise - to loop or not to loop,"Get Help,Git",logic-conditionals,3,"
Hi! I wasn’t sure if it’s appropriate to post this as a new post or if I should have posted it as a reply to
this thread, but I figured since the other post is 4 months old and my question is a bit different I should make a new one. Sorry if that’s not correct.
The guess the number game of that review has become a sort of obsession for me, since there are some things I just can’t seem to wrap my head around. I have tried many approaches, and I have made a few variants that work as they should.
Using a do-while loop (that I haven’t really learned about at this point in the course), and one version using a method to initialize the guessing (methods were a topic later on in the course).
I guess when I learn about the for loops I will get an even better way to make the game.
But my question is:
Is there any way to make this number guessing game do the following things with using only if-else, and or switch statements:

User inputs guesses
User gets notified if the number is too high/too low
User can guess again
AND when they guess correctly they get the option to start the game over again.

Since my knowledge of C# is at such a low level I can’t seem to figure this out, and it’s not for lack of trying! So if anyone with more experience could just let me know “this is impossible”, it would be really great for my peace of mind 
Or - if it is possible - give me a hint for how I can do it!
Links to the different variants of the game that I have made so far (to not make this post a million pages long  )

Iteration involves jumping in the code. Methods/functions, loops, gotos all do that.
If-statements and switch-statements do it too, but only forwards. To repeat something you need to go backwards.
Instead of visiting previous code you could put previous code in front of yourself - copy it. It wouldn’t be iteration but you’d be able to do something more than once by repeating code.

Ok, thank you for the answer, it is good to have it confirmed so I finally can put that question to rest!

39,C# Method Constructor Question from Quiz,"Get Help,Git",quiz,2,"
Hi, I got this wrong on the quiz.  I am confused why the class would run, if I am only creating an ‘object’

It would make sense if I called it like, Player();
","
Constructors run when creating an instance of the class (ignore static constructors). This class has 2 constructors: one that takes in a player name and one that takes in nothing.  The one that takes in nothing will call the constructor that takes in a player name, passing in the name “n/a”.  This is called constructor chaining.
public Player() : this(""n/a"")

The this(“n/a”) part is where it is calling the other constructor.
So the first constructor is always called no matter.

40,Lambda Expressions Clarification,"Get Help,Git",,2,"
In the first lesson of Lambda Expressions, how are the lambda expressions being defined? will the first array parameter being placed as the method’s parameter?
This is the example used:
string[  ] spaceRocks = {“meteoroid”, “meteor”, “meteorite”};
  bool makesContact = Array.Exists(spaceRocks, (string s) => s == ""meteorite"");

So would the variable ‘s’ be defined by the elements in the ‘spaceRocks’ array?
","
I know this is a bit old now and you probably figured it out, but I know lambdas confuse a lot of people.


How are the lands expressions being defined?
A lambda has a pattern of (parameters) => {code body}.
If there is one parameter being expected in then the () are not needed, if there are multiple then they will be needed.  The => part is what says this is a lambda function.  The code body is pretty much the same as a normal method code body, so you will do some logic in here and maybe return something, in this case a Boolean.


Will the first array parameter being placed as the method’s parameter?
Not 100% sure what you mean, so let me explain what is happening here behind the scenes (at a high level).
For the case of Array.Exists the array will be looped over with each item being passed into the lambda and it is run until one item returns true or it has gone through the whole list.  The array that is looped over is the first arguement passed I to Array.Exists, so spaceRocks.


So would the variable ‘s’ be defined by the elements in the ‘spaceRocks’ array?
Yes, s would represent an individual item in the spaceRocks array.


How a method that allows a lambda to be passed in will use it will vary and there should be some documentation explaining how it will be used.  This allows you to know what will be passed to it and what logic to put into your code block.

The error in question pertains to public void SpeedUp(double speed). This method worked correctly in previous exercises, and seems to written the same in the code solution, but I still cannot deduce what exactly I’m doing wrong here. Could anyone help?
","
Hello, @ptraynor894.
When you call the SpeedUp method, are you providing an argument? My guess would be no, since the method is intended to double the current speed. Your method takes a speed parameter, and adds it to the current value of Speed. That wouldn’t necessarily result in doubling the Truck object’s Speed value. For example, myTruck.SpeedUp(-25) would reduce the speed.

Here is the code currently. I have edited the method:
using System;

namespace LearnInterfaces
{
  class Truck : IAutomobile
  {
  	public string LicensePlate
    { get; }

    public double Speed
    { get; private set; }

    public int Wheels
    { get; }
    
    public double Weight 
    { get; }
   
    public void Honk()
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""HONK!"");
    }
    public Truck (double speed, double weight)
    {
     Speed = speed;
     Weight = weight;
     LicensePlate = Tools.GenerateLicensePlate();
     if (Weight < 400)
     { Wheels = 8;}
     else
     { Wheels = 12; }
    
    public void SpeedUp(double Speed)
    {
    Speed += 5;
    }
     
    }
  }
}

This has not fixed the problem, and error CS0106 still occurs.

Forgive my silliness in assuming you intended to double the speed. Tired I guess. I’ve looked at the exercise, and see what we’re tying to do now. The error you have is due to your SpeedUp method expecting an argument since you’ve included a parameter.



 ptraynor894:

    public void SpeedUp(double Speed)
    {
    Speed += 5;
    }



When the SCT for the lesson is testing your code, it calls the method, but does not include an argument. Calling the SpeedUp method should increment the Speed property value by 5 which your code will do, but you need to delete the parameter from the method declaration. The method should not accept any parameters.
Edit:
While the above is true (generates: error CS7036: There is no argument given that corresponds to the required formal parameter 'Speed' of 'Truck.SpeedUp(double)' [/home/ccuser/workspace/csharp-interfaces-finish-truck-class/LearnInterfaces.csproj]), it isn’t the source of the error you reported. I just ran your code, and now see the issue. You’ve included the SpeedUp method inside your constructor method. It needs to be inside the Truck class, but not inside the constructor. Cleaning up your indentation (making it consistent) will help avoid these errors in the future.

Thanks for sticking with me, I knew I’d done something dopey.

43,Modulo in Caeser Cypher,"Get Help,Git",arrays-loops,3,"
I’m able to complete, but having trouble understanding, step 12 in the Caeser Cypher.
It says that using modulo “wraps around” when you use the length of the array but I’m having trouble wrapping my head around (sorry for the pun) why this works.
Modulo is used to return a remainder when dividing a number by another correct? (i.e.  2 % 2  will return 0);
so why in:
using System;

namespace CaesarCipher
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      char[] alphabet = new char[] {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'};
      
      Console.WriteLine(""What would you like to encrypt?"");
      
      string userMessage = Console.ReadLine();
      
      char[] secretMessage = userMessage.ToCharArray();
      
      char[] encryptedMessage = new char[secretMessage.Length];
      
      for (int i = 0; i < secretMessage.Length; i++) {
        
        char letter = secretMessage[i];
        
        int newLetterIndex = Array.IndexOf(alphabet, letter);
        
        newLetterIndex = (newLetterIndex + 3) % alphabet.Length;
        
        char newLetter = alphabet[newLetterIndex];
        
        encryptedMessage[i] = newLetter;
                 
      }
      
      Console.WriteLine(String.Join("""", encryptedMessage));
    }
  }
}

does the module make my newLetterIndex variable “wrap around”?
","
Hello, @cuppettk.
Welcome to the forums!
Consider what happens with the letter ‘z’. The index of ‘z’ is 25. Add 3 to 25, and you get 28. Perform the modulo operation: 28 % 26, and you get 2. The letter at index 2 is ‘c’ which is exactly what we want. 
P.S. For future posts including code, please refer to this: How do I format code in my posts? Following the guidelines in the link will make your code appear as it does now.

@midlindner Thank you for the help. This sort of answered my question. I can see the logic of using it to reach an index of 2 so that was helpful.
What I was maybe more confused about was how all the other letters before x were accessible if you were using modulo to come up with the index.
The answer to that (which you did lead me to with your response so thank you ) ), is that when using modulo with a number less than itself (i.e. 25 % 28), then it returns the original value because it is not divisible by the modulus at least once, therefore the remainder is the whole of the original value.  (this is from what I understand using google)
I will be more careful to format my code from now on!

Hello there! This is my first time posting here.  I’m sorry if this seems like a simple newbie error, I’ve been learning C# since last week and I’m still pretty new to all of this.
So: I wanted to create a “custom” method. A method that when you call it in Main( ) along with 3 double values, it returns you a value using the Cuadratic Formula.
static double CuadraticFormula(double a, double b, double c)
        {
            double bPow = Math.Pow(b, 2);
            double ac = 4 * a * c;
            double e = Math.Sqrt(bPow - ac);
            return (b + e) / (2 * a);
        }

The problem is that, when I print this method, for example:
Console.WriteLine(cuadraticFormula(2, 3, 4));

It returns NaN, instead of a double.
I tried changing the code so It’s more organized, but it always returns NaN. What am I doing wrong here?
It would be great if you could help me. Peace
","
Hi and welcome to the forums!
The reason you’re getting NaN (Not a Number) is because of this line:



 thegaminglore2420482:

double e = Math.Sqrt(bPow - ac);


Math.Sqrt requires a positive number to return the square root as can be seen here.
The numbers you are passing in have a negative result, you’ll either have to change the values, or make the result of bPow - ac positive.




 louwding:

The numbers you are passing in have a negative result, you’ll either have to change the values, or make the result of bPow - ac positive.


Changing the value of e (by, say, taking the absolute value) might solve the programming error, but since we’re writing code here to solve a mathematical problem we cannot simply decide to change a term for our convenience. 
Whilst @louwding is correct about the source of your error, to understand why it’s producing that error we first need to understand the algebra behind the quadratic equation.
The variables inside of the square root are what can be referred to as a discriminant. Sticking solely with the quadratic form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the equation which allows us to solve for x is:

Here, our discriminant is b^2 - 4ac. This is what you are computing as Math.Sqrt(bPow - ac).
The discriminant, calculated on its own, allows us to deduce a few things about the solution(s) to our equation:

If the discriminant is zero, then there is a single solution to the quadratic.
If the discriminant is positive, then there are two real values of x which solve the quadratic.
If the discriminant is negative, then there are two complex values of x which solve the quadratic.

The discriminant in our case is 3^2 - (4 x 2 x 4), or -23, so we have no real solutions to the quadratic.
If we solve the quadratic here manually, we can calculate the two complex roots of your chosen quadratic.

If you want a challenge, C# can handle complex numbers. Alternatively, if you only want to deal with solving for real roots, you can add a check of whether the discriminant is greater-than-or-equal to zero before proceeding.

A simple way of looking at it is:
Any real number multiplied by itself will be a positive number:
a x a = a^2
2 x 2 = 2^2 = 4

-a x -a = (-a)^2
-2 x -2 = (-2)^2 = 4

Math.Sqrt(4) = 2

As you progress through C#, you’ll learn how to access methods, classes, etc. that are not inside of the Main() method. They may even be in totally separate files from the main method. 

Hi @midlindner
Thanks for the reply. Really appreciate it. Now, to say it clear. There is no need to do it. But right now it’s the only way to get a method to run we know.
Thanks a lot. Thums up for that.

Hi!
Working on a simple multiplication function, but I keep getting build errors with Codecademy’s compiler. In this particular case, it isn’t recognizing ToString or ToInt32, even though I’m using System. And maybe I’m doing other stuff wrong as well… not sure because I can’t get past this. Any advice?

Hello, @markholley.



 markholley:

      ToInt32(myAge); //this is a method of the Convert class
      myAge = myAge * dogYears;
      ToString(myAge); //incorrect syntax
      
      Console.WriteLine(""You are "", myAge, "" old."");



Your code has a couple of issues. For your conversion to an int, you can use Convert.ToInt32(string), but you’ll need to assign the converted value to another variable, or use it immediately. The same goes for using ToString(). Assign to new value to a variable, or use it immediately. You could do this:
      myAge = (Convert.ToInt32(myAge) * dogYears).ToString();
            
      Console.WriteLine(""You are "" + myAge + "" old.""); //use + to concatenate strings

Here, we’ve converted myAge to an integer, used that value immediately in the multiplication by dogYears and then converted that result, which is an integer, back to a string using ToString(). This string value is then assigned to myAge. A slightly more simplified approach would be to do this in steps:
      int TempIntAge = Convert.ToInt32(myAge);
      int myDogYearsAge = TempIntAge * dogYears;
      myAge = myDogYearsAge.ToString();
            
      Console.WriteLine(""You are "" + myAge + "" years old in dog years."");

You should note that you don’t need to convert myAge back to a string to concatenate its value into the output string, but you obviously can do so, if you wish.
Here is yet another approach:
      int dogYears = 7;
      int myAge; //declare myAge as an int
      
      Console.WriteLine(""Enter your age: "");
      myAge = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); //convert the input value prior to assigning it

      myAge *= dogYears;

            
      Console.WriteLine(""You are "" + myAge + "" years old in dog years."");

All of these methods have the potential flaw of the user entering something that cannot be converted to an integer. What if the user types Hello? You may want to look into the Parse and TryParse methods.
One last thing. The Codecademy learning environment won’t allow you to enter user input. To see your code in action, you may want to try running it on a site like repl.it.

Thank you midlindner, I appreciate your taking the time to explain all of this to me. Makes perfect sense. Have a good weekend.

I’m having a hard time figuring out how to capitalize the first letter of the first word in a sentence. Instead of “sEe me rUn” you get “See me run” as the output.

Hello, @jeanlaurore101.
It looks to me like you should be able to just add .ToLower() to the end of userInput.Substring(1). I’m not sure that’s what you’re after, but it would produce output like so:
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      string userInput = ""helLO WoRLd."";
      Console.WriteLine(userInput);
      //Output: helLO WoRLd.
      userInput = Char.ToUpper(userInput[0]) + userInput.Substring(1).ToLower();
      Console.WriteLine(userInput);
      //Output: Hello world.
    }

Your code already capitalized the first letter of the sentence. Adding .ToLower() to the end of the referenced expression converts all of the letters in the Substring to lower case.

Oh wow! I was missing .ToLower()
Thanks you a life saver!

You’re welcome! Happy coding!

49,Loops help,"Get Help,Git",,21,"
At the end of the loops interactive lesson, there is a challenge.
Try writing a program that:
Loops through a piece of text and only prints words that start with the letter “a” to the console to create a poem.
Let’s say I want to loop through this text:
“Another One Bites The Dust And Another One Down”
How would I go about doing that? What would I use to select only the words that start with the letter a? I have no clue where to begin. Thanks.
","
Hello, @micro6179079364.
You might start by investigating the String.Split() method. If you could convert your text into an array of words, you could then iterate through that array, and print only the words that begin with “a”. One noteworthy fact: You can access individual characters in a string by index the same way you can access elements of an array. Strings are in actuality arrays of individual characters. For example:
Console.WriteLine(""Hello World!""[6]); //prints: W

Hopefully this will help you to get started. If you need more help, feel free to ask. Good luck && happy coding!

Hi, thanks for setting me on the right track. After doing some research on the Googler, I came up with this:
using System;
class LoopsPractice {
  static void Main() {
    
    string[] counter = {""One"", ""Bites"", ""The"", ""Dust"", ""Down"", "" ""};
    
    string phrase = ""Another One Bites The Dust And Another One Down"";
    
    string[] words = phrase.Split(counter, System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

    foreach (var word in words)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(word);
    }
  }
}


I had to include "" "" (quotation marks with one space in between) in the array
string[] counter = {""One"", ""Bites"", ""The"", ""Dust"", ""Down"", "" ""};


to get rid of the  awkward spacing. I’m not sure why it got rid of the awkward spacing but it did it. It went from looking like this:
Another                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                
 And Another


to this :
Another                                                                                                                         
And                                                                                                                             
Another 


Zero spaces or any number other than one in between the quotation marks brings back the awkward spacing.
I’m glad I came up with the desired result of printing only the words that started with A, but I cannot help but think there are better ways to do this? How would you do it? Also why is var used here?
foreach (var word in words)


I switched out the word var with the word string and the code still runs fine. Thanks.




 micro6179079364:

words that started with A


You never test for this. That’s not what your code does. It does something else, and that’s also where your strange behaviour comes from.
When you describe what should happen, you do not specifically need to mention the words “One”, “Bites”, “The” … and so on. That wasn’t the requirement.

Oh dear, back to the drawing board I go. Thanks.

Hint: There’s another version of the String.split() method that would be easier for your purpose. If you’re curious, look into what this does:


Hint
      string text = ""Another One Bites The Dust And Another One Down"";
      string[] textArray = text.Split(' ');



One noteworthy fact: You can access individual characters in a string by index the same way you can access elements of an array. Strings are in actuality arrays of individual characters. For example:

Console.WriteLine(""Hello World!""[6]); //prints: W


Going back to that, and looking at this :
Hint

      string text = ""Another One Bites The Dust And Another One Down"";
      string[] textArray = text.Split(' ');


I can see that :
   Console.WriteLine(textArray[0]);  //prints: Another
   Console.WriteLine(textArray[1]);  //prints: One
   Console.WriteLine(textArray[2]);  //prints: Bites
   Console.WriteLine(textArray[3]);  //prints: The
   Console.WriteLine(textArray[4]);  //prints: Dust
   Console.WriteLine(textArray[5]);  //prints: And
   Console.WriteLine(textArray[6]);  //prints: Another
   Console.WriteLine(textArray[7]);  //prints: One
   Console.WriteLine(textArray[8]);  //prints: Down


Index  0 is Another, Index 1 is One, etc.
I’m not sure what to do with this new found information as I’m still unsure as to how I would filter out the words that don’t start with A. I’ll keep looking into it.




 micro6179079364:

    foreach (var word in words)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(word);
    }



What if you applied this logic to the textArray, but instead of printing every word only printed the words that you want?

I tried something like this
    foreach (var word in textArray)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(textArray[0]);
      Console.WriteLine(textArray[5]);
      Console.WriteLine(textArray[6]);
    }


but it doesn’t appear to be correct. It’ll repeat the desired result 3 times, I suppose once for each element in the array. I’ve been thinking of ways to make it not repeat but I’m drawing blanks. Or is this supposed to happen?
Edit: I thought I had already tried using BREAK to no avail yesterday but I tried it again today.
using System;
class LoopsPractice {
  static void Main() {
    
    string text = ""Another One Bites The Dust And Another One Down"";
    
    string[] textArray = text.Split(' ');
    
    //Console.WriteLine(textArray[0]);  prints: Another
    //Console.WriteLine(textArray[1]);  prints: One
    //Console.WriteLine(textArray[2]);  prints: Bites
    //Console.WriteLine(textArray[3]);  prints: The
    //Console.WriteLine(textArray[4]);  prints: Dust
    //Console.WriteLine(textArray[5]);  prints: And
    //Console.WriteLine(textArray[6]);  prints: Another
    //Console.WriteLine(textArray[7]);  prints: One
    //Console.WriteLine(textArray[8]);  prints: Down
    

    foreach (var word in textArray)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(textArray[0]);
      Console.WriteLine(textArray[5]);
      Console.WriteLine(textArray[6]);
      break;
    }
  }
}


I got the desired result again, hopefully this is it.

Isn’t it the program that should be figuring out which words to write out?
I don’t think it’s true that all possible pieces of text has a word at positions 0, 5, 6, and nowhere else.

So after you’ve split the words…
> myWords = words ""Another One Bites The Dust And Another One Down""
> myWords
[""Another"",""One"",""Bites"",""The"",""Dust"",""And"",""Another"",""One"",""Down""]

Is it possible to look at the first letters?
> map (take 1) myWords
[""A"",""O"",""B"",""T"",""D"",""A"",""A"",""O"",""D""]

And determine whether they’re equal to A?
> map (take 1 >>> (==""A"")) myWords
[True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False]

And from there decide which to keep…
> filter (take 1 >>> (==""A"")) myWords
[""Another"",""And"",""Another""]

And print them out?
> putStr $ unlines $ filter (take 1 >>> (==""A"")) myWords
Another
And
Another

Except, in C#, obviously.
Just like I did here, you’d want to start by writing out each word.
Then, see if you can isolate the first character…
compare it to A
do something based on the comparison
After having solved each subproblem, you can make sure it runs and that you have the right information before you move on




 micro6179079364:

    foreach (var word in textArray)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(textArray[0]); 
      Console.WriteLine(textArray[5]);

    }



What if you replace textArray with word in your Console.WriteLine() calls?

Is it possible to look at the first letters?

> map (take 1) myWords
[""A"",""O"",""B"",""T"",""D"",""A"",""A"",""O"",""D""]


Hi thanks, I had been thinking about that. To get the first letter I wanted to use substring like this:
    string index0 = textArray[0].Substring(0,1);
    Console.WriteLine(index0);
    
    string index1 = textArray[1].Substring(0,1);
    Console.WriteLine(index1);
    
    string index2 = textArray[2].Substring(0,1);
    Console.WriteLine(index2);
    
    string index3 = textArray[3].Substring(0,1);
    Console.WriteLine(index3);
    
    string index4 = textArray[4].Substring(0,1);
    Console.WriteLine(index4);
    
    string index5 = textArray[5].Substring(0,1);
    Console.WriteLine(index5);
    
    string index6 = textArray[6].Substring(0,1);
    Console.WriteLine(index6);
    
    string index7 = textArray[7].Substring(0,1);
    Console.WriteLine(index7);
    
    string index8 = textArray[8].Substring(0,1);
    Console.WriteLine(index8);


Then after that I would use an if statement to compare like this
    if (index0 == ""A"") {
      Console.WriteLine(""Another"");
    }


That’s all I have so far

Your code shouldn’t be mentioning any knowledge about the string. It shouldn’t mention the word “Another” because that might not be in the string. It should not mention specific locations, because you don’t know which locations exist.
You can only mention things that come directly from the requirement: “first letter”, “equal to a?”, that’s all you know.

If I did this:
    foreach (var word in textArray)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(word[0]);
      

I would get the first letter of each element without having to use substring.

 Now you’re making progress! 

Hello everyone. I just tried this exercise and thanks to this topic and a bit of googling, I figured it out!
I still have a few small things I wanted to ask. This is my code:
using System;

namespace LoopsReview
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      string text = ""An amazing butterfly. Soaring through the sweet summer air. He is looking for the kingdom of apples."";
      string[] words = text.Split("" "");
      foreach (string word in words)
      {
      if (word[0] == 'a')
      {
        Console.WriteLine(word);     
      }
      else if (word[0] == 'A')
      {
        Console.WriteLine(word);
      }
      }
    }
  }
}

My first question is how I can only get the words and leave things like dots and comma’s out. In my version here the words air and apples are printed like “apples.” and “air.” in the console.
Second question: I wrote an if and if else statements. One checks for the lower case letter ‘a’ and the other checks for the upper case letter ‘A’. Is there any shortcut how I can check for both uppercase and lower case at the same time? Any other feedback is highly appreciated since I just started learning to code with this website 4 days ago.
Thanks in advance!
P.S I am new to the website and have really been enjoying it and learning a lot 

Hello, @micwini.
Welcome to the forums!
Check out the methods I added to your code below. Google the unfamiliar methods (ie. Char.ToLowerInvariant(), TrimEnd()) for more information, and feel free to ask questions.
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {//declaring variables
      string text = ""An amazing butterfly. Soaring through the sweet summer air. He is looking for the kingdom of apples."";
      string[] words = text.Split("" "");
      char[] charsToTrim = {'.', ',', ';', '!', '?'};
      foreach (string word in words)
      {
        if (Char.ToLowerInvariant(word[0]) == 'a')
        {
          Console.WriteLine(word.TrimEnd(charsToTrim));    
        }
      }
    }

By converting the letter at word[0] to lowercase before comparing, we eliminate the need to compare to the uppercase A. We aren’t converting the letter to lowercase permanently. We are only comparing the lowercase equivalent of the letter (char). Happy coding!!

Hello, thanks for your help 
It works exactly as I wanted to now!
I only had one question: In the if statement, “Char.ToLowerInvariant…”
Where does the “Char” come from? Or is that part of the built in method?

Hi @trk075
The line char[] encryptedMessage = new char[5]; initialises the variable encryptedMessage as a char array with a “size” of 5.
You’re later trying to access encryptedMessage[5]. Array indexing begins at 0, so the highest value index you can retrieve would be encryptedMessage[4].

Also,



 trk075:

I have to access the character at position i in the secretMessage array and store it in a variable.


Your code doesn’t currently do that…

I have a new problem I am trying to run the code to convert the message but it is not working.
This is my current code:
using System;
namespace CaesarCipher
{
class Program
{
static void Main(string args)
{
char alphabet = new char {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’, ‘f’, ‘g’, ‘h’, ‘i’, ‘j’, ‘k’, ‘l’, ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘o’, ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’, ‘s’, ‘t’, ‘u’, ‘v’, ‘w’, ‘x’, ‘y’, ‘z’};
string secretMessage = String.Join("""", alphabet);
char secretArray = secretMessage.ToCharArray();
char encryptedMessage = new char[26];
for (int i = 0; i < secretMessage.Length; i++) {
char character = secretMessage[5];
char letter = alphabet[8];
encryptedMessage[1] = ‘f’;
}
int index = Array.IndexOf(alphabet, ‘a’ + 3);
Console.Write(secretMessage);
Console.ReadLine();
}
}
}

Hey @trk075
Couple of quick things.
Firstly, it helps a lot if you use the </>  icon on the editor toolbar to retain the formatting of your code. It puts a block in your post, like so:
```
your code here
```
so that the formatting stays the same as in your editor, like this:
function someStuff(args) {
    keep white_space;
}

Secondly, I’ve reformatted the code to what I think you wrote and I get several errors.
Can you re-post your code using the code formatting button, and provide also the errors that you’re getting please? 

This is my code in the way you wanted it:
namespace CaesarCipher
{
class Program
{
static void Main(string args)
{
char alphabet = new char {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’, ‘f’, ‘g’, ‘h’, ‘i’, ‘j’, ‘k’, ‘l’, ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘o’, ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’, ‘s’, ‘t’, ‘u’, ‘v’, ‘w’, ‘x’, ‘y’, ‘z’};
string secretMessage = String.Join("""", alphabet);
char secretArray = secretMessage.ToCharArray();
char encryptedMessage = new char[26];
for (int i = 0; i < secretMessage.Length; i++) {
char character = secretMessage[5];
char letter = alphabet[8];
encryptedMessage[1] = ‘a’;
}
int index = Array.IndexOf(alphabet, ‘a’ + 3);
Console.Write(secretMessage);
Console.ReadLine();
}
}
}

And the error is that messages are not converting

Hi @trk075
Thanks for that.
If I run the code, I get the following errors:
main.cs(5,13): warning CS0028: ‘CaesarCipher.Program.Main(string)’ has the wrong signature to be an entry point

Is that similar to what you’re getting?




 trk075:

This is my code in the way you wanted it:


You copied that from your post though, so it’s still different from the original >_<
It needs to be an exact copy otherwise… otherwise it’s different from the code you’re asking about, defeats the purpose of sharing it
At the very least the quotes are wrong, and there are missing using directives, and maybe there are more things after that, and it’s really hard to tell when one has stopped fixing formatting errors and when it actually looks like your code, if ever, not to mention that effort is spent on everything other than answering a question.
If your program doesn’t compile then you have to deal with the compile errors before you can consider how the program behaves. It sounds like you’re looking at error messages that are about a version you successfully compiled earlier.

Well my question is that the app is not running the messages that I want it to send as it is still the same. For example if I put abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz into secretMessage it comes out the same with no changes.

      for (int i = 0; i < secretMessage.Length; i++)
      {
        char letter = secretMessage[9];
        int index = Array.IndexOf(alphabet, 'a');
        
      }

      Console.ReadLine();
    }
  }
}

It is on the Caesar Cipher project page.

I am using program.cs on the Caesar Cipher task on learn C#

That’s so much better. Now we can actually talk about the same code.



 trk075:

For example if I put abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz into secretMessage it comes out the same with no changes.


There’s no code that changes secretMessage, not sure why you’d expect the output to change? Like, there’s nothing in the code that you can point at and say “these actions are being applied to the input to change it”, is there?
If you look at every use of the variable you’re printing, the only time it gets changed is when it is first set.
There are also some compiler warnings (I highly recommend that you turn on all warnings if you haven’t already) which point out that some variables are created but never used. So if they were meant to do anything, they definitely aren’t.
$ mcs /warn:4 CaesarCipher.cs
CaesarCipher.cs(11,14): warning CS0219: The variable `secretArray' is assigned but its value is never used
CaesarCipher.cs(12,14): warning CS0219: The variable `encryptedMessage' is assigned but its value is never used
CaesarCipher.cs(16,13): warning CS0219: The variable `index' is assigned but its value is never used
Compilation succeeded - 3 warning(s)

If you remove them, along with some other things that also do nothing (empty loop for example), you end up with:
using System;

namespace CaesarCipher
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      string secretMessage = ""giggles"";
      Console.Write(secretMessage);
      Console.ReadLine();
    }
  }
}

(also, I think it’s very weird to read a line and ignore it at the end of a program. The program should probably terminate instead)

So, perhaps what you would do next is to think about what steps need to be carried out for the program to do its job, and then compare that with your current code to determine which of those steps are missing…and write the code for those steps? You’d probably want some kind of value where you build up the output, starting out empty or maybe zero’d out…And the loop would probably be filling that out, and then after the loop has finished you wouldn’t print the variable referring to the original string, but instead the one referring to the value you just built.

(also, I think it’s very weird to read a line and ignore it at the end of a program. The program should probably terminate instead)


I’ve seen something similar in PowerShell to emulate the pause statement you can use with the Windows CLI, where using Read-Host ""Hit ENTER to exit..."" mimicks the Press any key to continue... prompt that pause would create.
This may be serving a similar purpose, to simply delay the program terminating?

Yeah it’s a windows thing. I’m not a windows user.
However, I still argue it isn’t how programs should behave, that the keep alive thing should be done by something separate.
For example I think visual studio might keep the console open for you, but if you double clicked your program from a graphical file explorer then you’d need it to pause. But if it’s a console program then it should be invoked from a console, sheesh.
Windows teaches its users to do all kinds of things wrong or not at all, people end up with really strange expectations about what things are and how they should behave. Is a program a window? If a program is not a window then why does it need to stay open, that doesn’t even make sense.




 ionatan:

For better or worse, a significant proportion of people who use Windows aren’t technically minded. As an OS, it has a lower barrier to entry than Linux so it’ll get used. Same as with smartphones, or any technology - users want their tech to “just work”, with little regard to how or why.
Going back to the issue at hand, though, I had a crack at implementing a Caesar cipher in C# myself. Had to trawl the docs a lot, as I don’t know C#, but managed to get one working.
@trk075 - can you post the link to the exercise you’re doing? I’m not sure what the instructions, or requirements, of the exercise are that you’re attempting to meet. 

I don’t mean that windows is worse, only that it hides and distorts. Linux/most other unixes desktop is obviously garbage because it’s a second class citizen (nobody cares to make it good). Darwin is pretty but otherwise I don’t know much. It doesn’t have the same barrier to programming, you can for example create a hello world in C and compile it without downloading anything at all while the same process in windows…???

Hello. I just tried writing a method to decrypt the caesar cipher, but I get an “unhandled exception” I have no clue how to fix.
This is my code for the decrypt method:
static string Decrypt(char[] characterArray, int cipher)
    {
     char[] alphabet = new char[] {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'};
      char[] encryptedMessage = new char[characterArray.Length];
      for (int i = 0; i < characterArray.Length; i++)
      {
        char letter = characterArray[i];
        if (Char.IsLetter(letter) == true)
        {
        int letterPos = Array.IndexOf(alphabet, letter);
        int newLetterPos = (letterPos - cipher) % alphabet.Length;
        char newLetter = alphabet[newLetterPos];  
        encryptedMessage[i] = newLetter;
        } 
      }
      return String.Join("""", encryptedMessage);      
    }

when cipher = 3 and characterArray contains a,b or c I get an unhandled exception. This because 2© -3 gives -1 which is not a possible position in the array. I thought this was solved by doing int newLetterPos = (letterPos - cipher) % alphabet.Length. Because for example 2 -3 % 25 gives 24.
So why doesn’t it work? Why does the console tell me it is out of bounds of the array?
I hope you guys know what I mean and thanks in advance 




 micwini:

Why does the console tell me it is out of bounds of the array?


How big is the array and what index did you use? Easy enough to print out to find out.

■■■■ you are fast!
The array has a size of 25, because the alphabet contains 26 letters.
The index I use is characterArray[i]. Because I need to run the loop for each letter.
I also have an encrypt method. That method is exactly the same as this one except the ‘-’ in (letterPos - cipher) % alphabet.length is a ‘+’. That one works perfectly and doesn’t give any exceptions, even when I try to encrypt letters and the end of the array like x, y and z.

51,Im struggling to understand method outputs,"Get Help,Git",,14,"
I don’t understand how using the out parameter works or how it’s supposed to give multiple outputs? the lesson gives the example:
static string Yell(string phrase, out bool wasYellCalled)
{
wasYellCalled = true;
return phrase.ToUpper();
}
and says we use out so that it will return multiple parameters but the only thing returned is the string? also what is even the point of bool wasYellCalled? when they solve it for you they redefine a new bool but I can’t understand the purpose of it.  sorry if this is a dumb question my brain is just not understanding 
","
Hello, @michelaplutoyahoo.co. Welcome to the forum!
Could you post a link to the exercise?

hi thanks! here it is: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/lessons/csharp-method-output/exercises/using-out?action=resume_content_item

Here’s the how the full example code would appear inside a program with a few additions to produce visible output:
static void Main(string[] args)
{
  string message = ""garrrr"";
  string yelledMessage = Yell(message, out bool flag); // Here we are sending message as a parameter and declaring a bool variable that is also sent as a parameter. Because of the out modifier the method must assign a value to this parameter. That value will be returned even though it isn't included in the return statement.
  Console.WriteLine(yelledMessage); //prints ""GARRRR""
  Console.WriteLine(flag); //prints ""True""
}

static string Yell(string phrase, out bool wasYellCalled) //because of the out modifier the bool variable wasYellCalled is also returned
{
  wasYellCalled = true; //the value for our out parameter is assigned here
  return phrase.ToUpper(); //the uppercase string is returned to the caller
}

Output:

GARRRR
True

Hopefully my comments in the code above have added a little clarity. The out parameter will be implicitly returned without having to be included in a return statement.
You can even return additional values:
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      string murmer = Whisper(""GARRRR"", out bool flag, out string hello);
      Console.WriteLine($""murmer is: {murmer}\nflag is: {flag}\nhello is: {hello}"");
    }

    static string Whisper(string phrase, out bool wasWhisperCalled, out string greet)
    {
      wasWhisperCalled = true;
      greet = ""Hello World!"";
      return phrase.ToLower();
    }

Output:

murmer is: garrrr
flag is: True
hello is: Hello World!

Hopefully this helps.

Most sane languages simply box up all the return values into a tuple and return that tuple.
C# came to its senses in 7.0 so you can do that here too. No need for arcane workarounds with out parameters.
using System;

namespace Derp {
class M {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        var (murmur, flag, hello) = Whisper(""GARRRR"");
        Console.WriteLine($""murmur is: {murmur}\nflag is: {flag}\nhello is: {hello}"");
    }

    static (string, bool, string) Whisper(string phrase) {
        return (phrase.ToLower(), true, ""Hello World"");
    }
}
}

If it’s the same thing then it should look the same too. Having one of the return values look different from the other two is weird.

Cool, but the exercise in question is teaching how to use out. Maybe you could suggest a curriculum update?

Now there’s a thought. Though, I have no clue how to phrase that to who or whether they’d want to change it, they may very well consider it “finished”

Thank you for explaining! sorry for the late reply…
I understand much better now, so thank you for your help! 
I have another question though if you or anyone else could answer it? in all the examples the out parameters were always just given a value that can never change, which seems less useful than just making a regular variable.  are you able to actually modify things using out? like say have an out parameter that would turn a string all uppercase? or is that something that can only be done within the return statement?

well, that’s significantly easier… I’ll definitely use this syntax once I’m working on my own code and out of the lesson program, so thank you for explaining it 

These out parameters are ‘regular’ variables, and can be further referenced, accessed, manipulated, etc. after they are implicitly returned by the method where they are assigned. I’ll try to explain with comments in the code from one of my previous posts:
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
     // the following line declares 3 variables: murmer, flag & hello
     // murmer will be assigned the value 'explicitly' returned by the Whisper method's return statement
     // flag and hello must be (and are) assigned values within the Whisper method
      string murmer = Whisper(""GARRRR"", out bool flag, out string hello); 
      // in this line we are printing the values of all 3 variables
      Console.WriteLine($""murmer is: {murmer}\nflag is: {flag}\nhello is: {hello}"");
     // we could continue to 'use' all 3 variables in our code for example:
      if (flag)  // test the value of 'flag'
      {
        // change the value of 'hello'
        hello += "" It is a beautiful Day!"";
        Console.WriteLine(hello); // print the new value of 'hello'
      }
    }
    // since we are passing 'out' arguments to this method, the method declaration must
    // include 'out' parameters to accept the arguments
    // then inside the code body of the method, the 'out' parameters must be assigned values
    static string Whisper(string phrase, out bool wasWhisperCalled, out string greet)
    {
        // this is assigning 'true' to the 'out' parameter 'wasWhisperCalled' which will then be
        // implicitly returned to the caller passing its value back to the original argument: flag
      wasWhisperCalled = true; 
      // same thing here: ""Hello World"" will be implicitly returned, and be assigned to 'hello'
      greet = ""Hello World!"";
      // 'phrase' is not an 'out' parameter
      // its value is modified here by the method and explicitly returned as the value 
      // assigned to 'murmer'
      return phrase.ToLower();
    }

Output:

murmer is: garrrr
flag is: True
hello is: Hello World!
Hello World! It is a beautiful Day!

Hopefully this makes things a little clearer, and I didn’t just add more confusion. Anyhow, as @ionatan mentioned:



 ionatan:

So, there is little need to spend too much time figuring out how to do something using an outdated technique other than to recognize what is going on if you come across it in a piece of code.

ah okay, thank you for all of your help : )

I’m stuck on this lesson as well. From a technical standpoint I get the gist of what the code itself is doing, but I don’t understand the why. Maybe give a real life example of what something like this would be used for? Here’s the code as it appears in the lesson:
static void Main(string args)
{
string statement = “GARRRR”;
string murmur = Whisper(statement, out bool marker);
Console.WriteLine(murmur);
}
static string Whisper(string phrase, out bool wasWhisperCalled)
{
  wasWhisperCalled = true;
  return phrase.ToLower();
}

That seems like a whole lot of work just to print “garrr” to the console. What exactly is the primary purpose of the bools that we’re outing?

In my opinion, as long as you understand what the code is doing, it’s mission accomplished. It’s just something to add to your knowledge base as something that can be done. You may or  may not ever use or see it again.

@jbendz you’re right to ask “why” whenever learning a new concept!
You’ll actually find a good example once you get to the “True or False?” project in Learn C#: Arrays and Loops. I’ll include a modified example that doesn’t use loops:
string input;
bool isBool;
bool inputBool;

Console.WriteLine(""An eggplant is also known as an aubergine."");
Console.WriteLine(""True or false?"");
input = Console.ReadLine();
isBool = Boolean.TryParse(input, out inputBool);

if (!isBool)
{
  Console.WriteLine(""Make sure to respond with true or false."");
  input = Console.ReadLine();
  isBool = Boolean.TryParse(input, out inputBool);
} 
else 
{
  bool answer = inputBool;
  // Maybe later you would compare this answer to the actual correct value, etc.
}

In this case Boolean.TryParse() returns a boolean that is true if the conversion succeeded and false otherwise. If it was a success, it sets the out argument to the converted value.
Let me know if that needs more clarification/explanation!
"
52,I don't understand the point of using out in this C# lesson,"Get Help,Git",methods,4,"
This is a little bit long, but I appreciate any help anyone can provide. This is C# Part 4 - Method Output lesson 5. Using Out.
This is the answer that Codecademy gives if you ask for solution. But you can get the same result without the out bool marker, so I don’t understand the purpose of using out here.
      string statement = ""GARRRR"";
			string murmur = Whisper(statement, out bool marker);
      Console.WriteLine(murmur);

I also don’t understand where marker comes from. It’s not declared anywhere I can see it. How come it doesn’t read    Whisper(statement out bool wasWhisperCalled);   like it does when you’re creating the method?
Here is the full solution provided by Codecademy:
using System;

namespace UsingOut
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      string statement = ""GARRRR"";
			string murmur = Whisper(statement, out bool marker);
      Console.WriteLine(murmur);
    }  
    
    static string Whisper(string phrase, out bool wasWhisperCalled)
    {
      wasWhisperCalled = true;
      return phrase.ToLower();
    }
	}
}


And here is my solution:
using System;

namespace UsingOut
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Whisper(""Hello"", out bool param2);
    }
    
    static string Whisper(string param, out bool param2)
    {
      //declare string sentence variable
      string sentence = param;
      //set sentence to lower case
      sentence = sentence.ToLower();
      //set bool to true, not sure why but codecademy liked it when I did this.
      param2 = true;
      //print to console
      Console.WriteLine(sentence);
    }
	}
}


It got a few errors, but it passed all the codecademy tasks. It doesn’t print and not all code paths return a value. I figure I could move Console.WriteLine to Main() to fix the printing. But I’m pretty lost with the out bool marker part.

Hi @giantgough - welcome back to the forums! 
I’ll do my best to provide some clarity, though I’m going to answer parts of your post out-of-order because I think it’ll help clear things up.



 giantgough:

I also don’t understand where marker comes from. It’s not declared anywhere I can see it.


Since C# 7, we’ve been able to declare the out variable inside the method call. So, we can either do this:
bool marker;
string murmur = Whisper(statement, out marker);

or this:
string murmur = Whisper(statement, out bool marker);

The second version is more compact, but because we’re declaring the variable inside the method call we need to provide the type - bool in this case. (For C# 6 and older versions, the only acceptable way to do this was the first example where we declare the variable ahead of the method call.)



 giantgough:

How come it doesn’t read Whisper(statement, out bool wasWhisperCalled); like it does when you’re creating the method?


In the method definition, wasWhisperCalled is the parameter. In the method call, we’re declaring a new variable called marker to hold the value which comes back from the method through the out parameter. marker is just a variable in the method call, so we can name it whatever we want.



 giantgough:

It got a few errors, but it passed all the codecademy tasks.


I’ll have to reset the exercise and try your code to be sure, but I think you’ve managed to fudge it because the SCT is simply checking for the presence of some expected lines of code and not actually validating the output… As a result, your code isn’t a valid solution to the final task - it doesn’t do what is being asked, as you mention…



 giantgough:

It doesn’t print and not all code paths return a value. I figure I could move Console.WriteLine to Main() to fix the printing.


You couldn’t move the line Console.WriteLine(sentence) to the main method verbatim without changing the variable being printed, but even then your code would still fail and not write anything to the console. This is because you’re getting the error message Not all code paths return a value; your method declaration specifies that Whisper() returns a string but your method never does so you get an error rather than hello written to the console. You need to add a return statement to the method. 
Which brings us back around to…



 giantgough:

This is the answer that Codecademy gives if you ask for solution. But you can get the same result without the out bool marker, so I don’t understand the purpose of using out here.


The lesson asks you to create a method, Whisper(), has two parameters: a string and an out bool.
As I mentioned earlier, when we call the method we can pass in or declare any variable we like for the out bool parameter - Codecademy’s solution has opted to use a variable marker, whereas you went for the same name as your method definition and used param2.
However, the two solutions do not generate the same result. The Codecademy solution ends up with the variable murmur assigned the value garrrr and marker assigned the value true, with both being in-scope and printable to the console from within main(). Your solution fails to build because of the not all code paths return a value error.
If we focus on the out part



 giantgough:

I don’t understand the purpose of using out here


The exercise is, I think, simply meant to get you used to using out as a fudge to work around a limitation of C# when you want to return more than one thing from your methods. As it happens, I don’t think the exercise requires or checks whether you print the out bool variable so it is sort of pointless here - aside from getting you to practice using it, that is.
(As an aside, this is a limitation which sort of no longer exists because Microsoft have expanded on their implementation of tuples as of C# 7 and you can return multiple values as a tuple from methods now.)
One final thing. Your solution is easily 95% of the way to being correct; the only issues are the missing return in Whisper() and the misplaced Console.WriteLine(), though the latter is really only wrong because the lesson asks you to print the returned value… so please don’t take this as a huge dig at your code because it’s really not far off! 
Hopefully I’ve not confused you further, and you understand why CC went for out bool marker in their example solution. Let us know if you’ve any further questions, though. 

This was extremely helpful. Thank you very much.

 madaskalas:

Why each method needs a return statement?


not each method needs a return statement, but looking at your Yell method:
static string Yell(string item) {
	Console.WriteLine(item);
}

you see string after static? This means your method returns a string, if you don’t want to return anything, use void instead.



 madaskalas:

How Console.WriteLine() differs from return ?


writeLine writes output to the console, return hands data back to the caller.



 madaskalas:

Why you can return only one value?


you could return an array/list, which can contain multiple values. But that only one type can be returned is super useful once your code base grows, then people calling methods written by other developers team, know what to expect.



 madaskalas:

Why I get the above error?


i think i covered this?




 madaskalas:

Why you can return only one value?


Nothing’s stopping you from storing multiple values in the value that you returned. See tuples, especially.
If you called the function and got its result, then where is the other result? …doesn’t really add up does it, similar to how if you promise to return a value, except you don’t, then what ends up being the result? Doesn’t add up.




 stetim94:

writeLine writes output to the console, return hands data back to the caller.


What exactly means hands data back to the caller?

here:
CallMe(""John"")

you call the function, so return hands back the data to the function call, which you then decide to write to the console

Hi @jevinr
You’ve quoted your code, rather than using the </> code formatting option in the editor which isn’t great for us to be able to copy and run your code to help troubleshoot.
The actual root cause of your error:
Preformatted textProgram.cs(19,11): error CS1001: Identifier expected [/home/ccuser/workspace/csharp-working-with-text-get-parts-of-strings/e7-workspace.csproj]
is your variable declaration here:
int 2ndcharPosition = name.IndexOf(""Hesam Abbasi"");
It’s not valid syntax in C# to start a variable name with a number.
As for why it allowed you to progress? I can only assume that, despite the error in your code, you’ve met whatever the requirements were for the SCT. (I guess it must just be looking, maybe using regex, for you to have included the method calls the instructions ask for.)

Thank you so much! I am sorry, I will paste code with </>

// all is fine till here, step 13, store users input in responses array 
responses[input] = isBool;



What is the value of input, and is that a valid value to pass as an index to an array?

input is true or false and need to store those values in responses array so I could later compare them as it says in the task. I just do not know how to write it correctly so it actually is stored.
Otherwise, if I run the code, last foreach loop for testing purposes prints out False False False instead of what I have typed.

Hello, @viesisvalmiera. Welcome to the forum.
As @thepitycoder pointed out, it appears your issue is right here:



 viesisvalmiera:

responses[input] = isBool; //input is not the variable you assigned to be used as an index
askingIndex++; //here you are incrementing the index variable, but you haven't used it as the index



You assigned an index variable, but you aren’t using it:



 viesisvalmiera:

int askingIndex = 0; 



Also, in the same assignment to you responses array:



 viesisvalmiera:

responses[input] = isBool; //'isBool' isn't the variable pointing to the user's answer



You aren’t using the variable that the user’s answer was assigned to. You are using the variable that contains the returned value of testing whether the user’s answer can be parsed into a bool. It will always be ‘True’ at this point. I believe inputBool is the variable containing the user’s parsed answer:



 viesisvalmiera:

            bool isBool;
            bool inputBool; //defined here

            isBool = Boolean.TryParse(input, out inputBool); //assigned value here

            

            while (isBool != true)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(""Please respond with 'true' or 'false'."");
                input = Console.ReadLine();
                
                isBool = Boolean.TryParse(input, out inputBool); //or here if the initial answer failed to parse



One last tip:
while (isbool != true)

Is the same as:
while(!isbool)

Happy Coding!

Hi, I am learning as well.   I know there has got to be a better way, however this will work.
This will answer question 13.  This will store the users input in an array.
I did this.
bool  responses = new bool[questions.Length];
    int i = 0;
    responses[i]=inputBool;
    i++;

I think that is pretty much what the exercise expected you to do. 

I know this works, because I can test it like this:
int i = 0;
responses[i]=inputBool;
i++;
Console.WriteLine(responses[0]);
break;
However, on line 14.  It wants you to print the results outside of the 2 main loops.
So I created a simple for loop outside of the 2 main loops, to print the array out, this is the logic:
 Console.WriteLine(""The users Input"");
 Console.WriteLine(""==============="");
 for (int i = 0; i <responses.Length; i++)
 {
    Console.WriteLine(responses[0]);
 }

However, I get a console error:
Program.cs(69,27): error CS0103: The name ‘responses’ does not exist in the current context
[/home/ccuser/workspace/csharp-true-or-false/TrueOrFalse.csproj]
This almost reads like the array ‘responses’ is out of scope??  Not sure how, I am still in the main method?
Again, I am learning too.  It probably is me, hmmmmm

Would need to see all of your code to determine the scope of your responses array, but that is what the error is telling you. Also, here: Console.WriteLine(responses[0]); you’ll want to change your index 

You are right, I should do
Console.WriteLine(responses[i]);
Thank you!

I see a few issues.
First,



 bassdb:

int i = 0;
responses[i]=inputBool;



Your responses array should be declared before the for loop not inside of it.
You don’t actually need int i = 0;. You are using i instead of the intended index variable declared here:



 bassdb:

int askingIndex = 0;



If you’d rather use i that’s perfectly fine, but it needs to be declared outside of the for loop as well in place of askingIndex.
Because responses is declared inside the for loop it is limited in scope to the for loop. It should be declared right after your answers array.
This:



 bassdb:

i++;



is in the correct place, but will need to match the index variable declaration whether you change askingIndex to i or change i++ to askingIndex++.
Implement these changes, and we’ll see what we have.
Edit:
Aside, these lines located inside the for loop:
    int i = 0;
    responses[i]=inputBool;
    i++;

will result in only the last response being stored. You reset i to 0 each time the loop iterates, so each response is written at the same index of 0. Making the corrections noted above will correct this behavior.




 midlindner:

Your responses array should be declared before the for loop not inside of it.
You don’t actually need int i = 0; . You are using i instead of the intended index variable declared here:

Hello, @jeanlaurore101.
Look in your Main method inside the first if statement’s block. For something other than an error message to be printed to the console, it must have come from your code.
What is printed to the console when we try to print an array using Console.WriteLine()?

I’m still confuse. I can’t seem to find the problem. I tried multiple time.

This line: Console.WriteLine(""\r\n"" + returnRandom); is printing: System.Int32[].
When you try to print an array like returnRandom you’ll get its type not the values stored in the array. It doesn’t appear that you need that line in your code at all. You already have a method that iterates through the array, and prints its values called OutputTheArray.

Thank you very much!

You’re very welcome!

If you click the </> button, you’ll see the image below. Then paste your code in the highlighted area.

When you do that, your code’s original formatting will be preserved, and those seeking to help you, can copy your code, and run it for themselves to aid you in debugging. You code will appear like this:

 clutzyninja:

Did I accidentally write some code that the system can’t process?


could be an infinity loop, this looks weird:
emails = emails--;

using -- is a shorthand, if we change your code to the full code (without shorthand), we get:
emails = emails = emails - 1

emails-- is short for emails = emails - 1.

I changed it to
emails - 1
and it works.
Why though?  Why wouldn’t
emails–
work here?  Isn’t it the same thing?




 stetim94:

It is exactly an infinite loop.



 clutzyninja:

Why though? Why wouldn’t
emails–
work here? Isn’t it the same thing?


No, it’s not the same thing.
The C# decrement operator -- comes in two variants, which Microsoft refers to as “postfix” and “prefix”.
You’re using the “postfix” form, i.e. emails--. The output of this operator, i.e. the value you get back if you assign it to another variable, is the value of the operand before the operation.
Your code is therefore repeatedly re-assigning emails to the same value, and never decrementing it. We can demonstrate this like so:
int number = 3;
Console.WriteLine(number);  // output: 3
Console.WriteLine(number--); // output: 3
Console.WriteLine(number); // output: 2

Conversely, if we were using the “prefix” form of the operator - which would be --emails - then the output of that operation is the value of the operator after the operation is performed. Like so:
int another_number = 3;
Console.WriteLine(another_number); // output: 3
Console.WriteLine(--another_number); // output: 2
Console.WriteLine(another_number); // output: 2

As a demonstration:
using System;

class MainClass {
  public static void Main (string[] args) {
    int emails = 5;
    Console.WriteLine(""The value of 'emails' is: "" + emails); // output: The value of 'emails' is: 5
    emails = emails--;
    Console.WriteLine(""The value of 'emails' after the decrement operator -- is: "" + emails); // output: The value of 'emails' after the decrement operator -- is: 5
  }
}

As you can see, the value of emails never changes so the condition for your while loop never becomes false. Thus, the code never finishes. 
Does that help? You can run my terrible example code above on a repl, if you want.
Edit: The above stuff about “postfix” and “prefix” operators is semantic, really.
To fix your code, you can do either of the following.
Solution A - Use the decrement operator only
while (emails > 0)
{
  emails--;
}

Solution B - Write the full arithmetic operation “longhand”
while (emails > 0)
{
  emails = emails - 1;
}


Makes total sense.  I was unaware of the prefix option, and really of how decrement works.   Apparently the lesson that mentioned increment and decrement did a piss poor job at explaining how they work, at least from what I recall of it.
Thank you!

No worries, glad we cleared it up. 
Edit: The increment and decrement operators, ++ and --, just get tacked on to whatever operand you want to run the operation on. E.g.
i--; // decrement the value of i by 1
money++; // increment the value of money by 1

// these will produce the same end result, changing the variables by 1 in each case:
++money;
--i;


emails-- would work, emails = emails-- doesn’t work.

Which step fails? You need to set the amount of guests depending on the step you are on (for step 1, set guests to 6)

Hello @ps3.
I just ran your code. It seems the SCT for the lesson is expecting you to use an else if to check for 0 guests instead of simply an else statement.

And the directions say to use a if not a else if
So that needs to be fixed in the system correct?

The directions just say:

Lastly, if no one shows up, have the program print Solitaire to the console.

However, the hint says:

When writing an else statement, make sure it comes after your if and else if statements:

So, you are correct that the lesson should be ‘fixed’. The way you did it originally is how I would have done it as well with an else statement. I don’t know why the SCT expects an else if, but it does. Feel free to click on the Get Help icon, and submit a Bug Report. The directions clearly don’t match what is expected.

I think you’re correct @midlindner, but thinking about it, that’s the only way it makes sense. Solitaire can only ever be played with one person and the else statement would be applicable to groups of 2,4,5+. But I definitely think the hint is kinda misleading.

Yeah. The whole premise that you’re having guests over to play a game, and you’ll have 6 guests, 3 guests or no guests is kinda odd. Would be more ‘real world’ if they were ranges like 4-6, 1-3, or 0. Oh well. In the grand scheme of things it’s not that big a deal. The purpose of the lesson was to teach the use of else if. I suppose it more or less does.

64,C# Conditional Statements Review Excercise,"Get Help,Git",,9,"
I’m studying C# and am currently working on the lessonConditional Statements. I tried one of the excercises they suggest at the end of the lesson. I chose the one saying: “Have a user guess a random number between 1-10 and lets them know if they got it correct, are too low, or are too high”.

Hi and welcome to the Forum!
Take a closer look at your third line of code. You ask for an input of the user and convert it to an Int. What happens to the user input afterwards?

I’m not sure… I was told that any input is automatically treated as a string, so if you expect a number, you should convert it. But maybe I didn’t quite understand it? Still, if I delete Convert.ToInt32, the answer 2 is still correct, even though it shouldn’t be…

You are correct, that you have to convert it to an int, since you want to compare two numbers.
Your number variable stores 7.
In your switch block you check if different cases are true for your variable number.
Did number change in any way or is it still 7?
What do you think?

I think I get it   At least, now the outcome is as expected when I run the program!

switch (Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine())) {
case 1:
Console.WriteLine(“Het goede getal is hoger.”);
break;


Nice! Now your switch block checks the user input instead of the number variable.
Have you tried changing your number for something else than 7?
Does your code still work?

Thanks for your help! 
Of course the code still ‘works’… But it still states that 7 is correct.
I think I can fix that 

You’re very welcome!
Sure, feel free to post again, if you get stuck.
Just some hints to point you in the right direction:


At the moment you store only one number and never use it again.


You want to compare two numbers, so you should save the user input to another variable.


Your switch block has redundant code. You define many different cases for each possible number, which often give the same response! (e. g. “Number is higher” or “Number is lower”. But how can you know what number was randomly generated? You can’t change your code while its being run. Let the machine do the thinking!


This can be solved if you think of all the cases there are and what should happen in each case. There are actually only 3 cases which matter for comparing the numbers. Can you figure out which 3 cases there are?
NOTE: If you want to solve it this way, you shouldn’t use switch. You’d rather prefer if-else conditionals.



Thanks again for your help! It works with different ‘correct numbers’ now!

  	int correctNumber = 6;
  
  Console.WriteLine(""Let's play guess the number! Choose a number between 1 and 10"");
  
  int guessedNumber = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
     
  if (guessedNumber < correctNumber) {
    Console.WriteLine(""The correct number is higher than the number you chose."");
  }
  
  else if (guessedNumber == correctNumber) {
    Console.WriteLine(""Correct!"");
  }
      
  else {
    Console.WriteLine(""The correct number is lower than the number you chose."");
  }

    { this.country = country; }
    { this.pronouns = pronouns; }
  }
}


Ah. Ok. You just need to remove the { }'s around your property assignments inside the constructor. The constructor is a block, but each property is just a statement inside the block:
public Constructor( string prop1, int prop2) //This is just an example. Don't use the name Constructor.
{
  this.prop1 = prop1;
  this.prop2 = prop2;
}

And this is the code:

  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Profile sam = new Profile();
      sam.name = ""Sam Drakkila"";
      sam.age = 30;
      sam.city = ""New York"";
      sam.country = ""USA"";
      sam.pronouns = ""he/him"";
    }
  }
}



Since you now have a constructor in place, you pass arguments to the constructor when you instantiate a new Profile object. Trying to assign properties like this: sam.name = ""Sam Drakkila""; still doesn’t work for the same reason it didn’t work earlier. Those properties of the object are private. The constructor method is public though, so we use it to create new instances of the object with its property values passed in as arguments like so:
Profile sam = new Profile(""Sam Drakkila"", 30, ""New York"", ""USA"", ""he/him"");

The order of the arguments needs to match the order that the parameters appear in the constructor declaration: public Profile(string name, int age, string city, string country, string pronouns = ""they/them"")

So nothing get printed right.

That’s right. At this point nothing should appear in the console. You’ll have to complete the next step to code the ViewProfile() method. Then you’ll be able to print sam's profile to the console.

I have a new error:

    { this.name = name; this.age = age; this.city = city; this.country = country; this.pronouns = pronouns; }
    
    public ViewProfile()
    {
      string bio = $""Name: {name},\nAge: {age},\nCity: {city},\nCountry: {country}"";
      return bio;
    }
  } 
}


You have an error message. Did you read it? Then what?
If you identify what stops you then that gives you something to find out more about.
It seems like there are still things that you can do yourself, at least from what you’ve said about it.
It won’t be useful to you to have other people tell you the conclusion of what to do to fix something. The thing to learn is how to reach the conclusion of what to do, isn’t it? So you have to go through all the steps that somebody else would, even if it takes time, especially if it takes time.

Hello, @ruby4126738306. Welcome to the forum!



 ruby4126738306:

int letterPosition = (index += 3 % 26);


Your problem appears to be in this line. Re-check the hint from the lesson. A portion of what you have inside the parenthesis belongs on the outside. 
P.S. I’d change += to just +. No need to change the value assigned to index. You just need to calculate the value to be assigned to letterPosition.

69,Caesar Cipher C#,"Get Help,Git",,7,"
Hello,
I’ve been trying to learn how to code with C# for only about 3 weeks now, and this website has been very helpful. However I have been running into an error when trying to run this code and I do not know how to fix it.
using System;

namespace CaesarCipher
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      char[] alphabet = new char[] {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'};
      Console.WriteLine(""type a message to encrypt it."");
      string message = Console.ReadLine();
      char[] secretMessage = message.ToCharArray();
      
      char[] encryptedMessage = new char[secretMessage.Length];
      
      int i;
      for(i = 0; i < secretMessage.Length; i++)
      {
        char secretItem = secretMessage[i];
        int index = Array.IndexOf(alphabet, secretItem);
        int letterPosition = (index += 3) % 26;
        int encryptedCharacter = alphabet[letterPosition];
        encryptedMessage[i] = alphabet[encryptedCharacter];        
      }
      
      string superSecretMessage = String.Join("""", encryptedMessage);
      Console.Write(superSecretMessage);
    }
  }
}

When I run this code and type “hello” into the console it gives me an unhandled exception error. Same with any other word or character.
If anyone would be willing to point out me what exactly I am doing wrong. It would be very appreciated.
","
Your problem is this line:
int encryptedCharacter = alphabet[letterPosition];
Let’s say your plain-text is “hello”.
On the first iteration of your loop - i = 0 - your variables will be as follows:
i = 0
secretItem = ""h""
index = 7
letterPosition = 10

We then arrive at the line int encryptedCharacter = alphabet[letterPosition];.
Here, we’re assigning the value of alphabet[letterPosition], which at this stage of the code is k, to the variable encryptedCharacter.
Unfortunately for you, you’ve declared encryptedCharacter as an int - so this variable gets the value 107, which is the decimal representation of the ASCII code for k.
We then try and do encryptedMessage[i] = alphabet[encryptedCharacter], which is the same as encryptedMessage[0] = alphabet[107].
alphabet doesn’t have a 107th item, so you get an IndexOutOfRangeException thrown and your code bails out.
I’ll leave it to you to figure out how to fix this, though. 

Thank you very much!, I did not know it worked liked that and would never have guessed it in a million years. I just fixed it by subtracting 97 from the encryptedCharacter variable within the loop. and it works perfectly now!




 java7181898703:

I just fixed it by subtracting 97 from the encryptedCharacter variable within the loop. and it works perfectly now!


That’s one way of fixing it, but would it not be better to change the code like so?
using System;

namespace CaesarCipher
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      char[] alphabet = new char[] {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'};
      Console.WriteLine(""type a message to encrypt it."");
      string message = Console.ReadLine();
      char[] secretMessage = message.ToCharArray();
      
      char[] encryptedMessage = new char[secretMessage.Length];
      
      int i;
      for(i = 0; i < secretMessage.Length; i++)
      {
        char secretItem = secretMessage[i];
        int index = Array.IndexOf(alphabet, secretItem);
        int letterPosition = (index += 3) % 26;
        char encryptedCharacter = alphabet[letterPosition]; // this line now gets the encrypted character as a CHAR
        encryptedMessage[i] = encryptedCharacter; // so we can just pop it directly into the encrypted message!
      }
      
      string superSecretMessage = String.Join("""", encryptedMessage);
      Console.Write(superSecretMessage);
    }
  }
}

This way, you’re not making another unnecessary lookup by index of your alphabet variable.
Edit: Incidentally, this isn’t the first time I’ve responded to a thread about the Caesar Cipher in C#. After the last one, I decided to throw together a “quick and dirty” C# Caesar Cipher of my own…


I came up with this...
using System;
using static System.Array;
using static System.Char;

class MainClass {
  public static void Main (string[] args) {
    // alphabet for shifting
    char[] alpha = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"".ToCharArray();

    // caesar shifter
    int shift_by = 3; // +ve: shift right, -ve: shift left

    // message to be enciphered:
    string encipher_me = ""placeholder text though caesar ciphers are cryptographically weak"";
    Console.Write(""Please enter your message for encryption: "");
    encipher_me = Console.ReadLine();
    // placeholder for encrypted message
    string encrypted = """";

    // encrypt the message
    for (int i = 0; i < encipher_me.Length; i++)
    {
      char space = '\u0020';
      if (encipher_me[i] != space) {
        char el;
        if (IsUpper(encipher_me[i])) {
          el = ToLower(encipher_me[i]);
        }
        else {
          el = encipher_me[i];
        }
        int ai = IndexOf(alpha, el);
        int ni = (((ai + shift_by) % 26) + 26) % 26;
        encrypted = encrypted + alpha[ni];
      }
      else {
        encrypted = encrypted + space;
      }
    }

    Console.Write(encrypted);
  }
}

Emphasis on “quick and dirty”… It’s not meant to be perfect. Just wanted to see what I could do. 


Could also use Linq’s select or Select to obtain each individual character, the result of that would be an iterable of characters which is exactly what string.Join takes as input.
using System.Linq;

...

string input = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine(
  string.Join("""", input.Select(encodeChar))
);

...

static char encodeChar(char ch) {
  // subtract 'a', add 3, mod 26, add 'a'
}





 ionatan:

Could also use Linq’s select


I think Linq is a bit beyond the scope of the C# course here.
I’ve worked with devs who find that stuff confusing, so might be a bit much for newbies.
(It is pretty good, though!)

yeah I am a bit of a newbie, thanks for the help tho, and yeah your way is the correct way to do it. if you have any tips or extra resources for me to learn, could you let me know? again thank you for the help

Hello @2502541822! Welcome to the forum. If you could post your code again using the </> icon, it would help us to be able to see exactly what your code looks like. It’s easiest to click the </> first, and then paste your code in the space indicated. It preserves formatting, and special characters like [], so they don’t look like .
I believe though, that your error is caused by your placement of the static double Rect() method. The method should be located inside the Program class, but not inside the Main method.

Sorry for the format.

You can add another scope by nesting code inside {}
(or move them out into separate functions)

I’m sorry, I don’t quite understand. How may that help me with correctly executing this function?

Wasn’t the problem that you’re declaring the same variable more than once in the same scope?
The solution then would be to either use different names, or put them in different scopes.

Hello, @cara! Welcome to the forum.
Are you sure that all 7 steps have been checked off as completed? You have to manually check them off yourself in this project.

Thanks, I discovered this eventually but why is it necessary to tick of manually when the other exercises tick off when the task is completed?

There are several projects like this throughout the Codecademy curriculum. You are left more on your own, and there is no SCT checking each step to see if you completed it correctly. You have to complete each step, and decide for yourself if it is working properly. If so, check it off.

I tried and tried and I cant get the result i need. Plz help!

If it were me, I would try using a variable to store the number of each shirt size. You could use either a series of if() statements or a switch() block to determine which variable to increment as you iterate over the array. For example:
string[]  socksInDrawer = new string[] {""white"", ""black"", ""black"", ""white"", ""black"", ""black"", ""white""};
int whiteSockCount = 0;
int blackSockCount = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < socksInDrawer.Length; i++) 
{
  if (socksInDrawer[i] == ""white"")
  {
    whiteSockCount++;
  }
  if (socksInDrawer[i] == ""black"") 
  {
    blackSockCount++;
  }
//if there were more sock colors, we would add more if()'s
}
Console.WriteLine(""I have {0} white socks, and {1} black socks."", whiteSockCount, blackSockCount);

Or you could replace the if()'s with:
switch (socksInDrawer[i])
{
  case ""white"":
    whiteSockCount++;
    break;
  case ""black"":
    blackSockCount++;
    break;
}

Good luck! Post again, if you get stuck.

Thank you very much brother!

77,Choose your own adventure step #14,"Get Help,Git",,4,"
I’m stuck at step #14. The project asks that you check if the user entered “NOTHING” as the answer to the riddle. The tricky thing is that the code flow is already inside of an if statement. I can’t figure out how to check the users answer when I think the program is waiting for the answer to a different question (OPEN or KNOCK). Here’s my code:
 // Start by asking for the user's name:
  Console.Write(""What is your name?: "");
  string name = Console.ReadLine();
  Console.WriteLine($""Hello, {name}! Welcome to our story."");

Console.Write(“It begins on a cold rainy night. You’re sitting in your room and hear a noise coming from down the hall. Do you go investigate?”);
Console.WriteLine(“Type YES or NO:”);
string noiseChoice = Console.ReadLine();
string choice1UpperCaseify = noiseChoice.ToUpper();
    if (choice1UpperCaseify == ""NO"")
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""Not much of an adventure if we don't leave our room!"");
      Console.WriteLine(""THE END."");
    }
    else if (choice1UpperCaseify == ""YES"")
    {
     Console.WriteLine(""You walk into the hallway and see a light coming from under a door down the hall."");
      Console.WriteLine(""You walk towards it. Do you open it or knock?"");
    Console.WriteLine(""Type OPEN or KNOCK:"");
    string doorChoice = Console.ReadLine();
    string upperDoorChoice = doorChoice.ToUpper();
  }
    if (upperDoorChoice == ""KNOCK"")
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""A voice behind the door speaks. It says Answer this riddle:"");
      Console.WriteLine(""Poor people have it. Rich people need it. If you eat it you die. What is it?"");
     Console.WriteLine(""Type your answer:"");
      string riddleAnswer = Console.ReadLine();
      string upperCaseRiddle = riddleAnswer.ToUpper();
    }
/*
    else if (upperCaseRiddle == ""NOTHING"")
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""The door opens and NOTHING is there.You turn off the light and run back to your room and lock the door."");
      Console.WriteLine(""THE END"");
    }
     else
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""The door is locked! See if one of your three keys will open it."");
      Console.WriteLine(""Enter a number (1-3):"");
      string keyChoice = Console.ReadLine();
     }
    
   else 
    {
      (Console.WriteLine(""You answered incorrectly. The door doesn't open.""));
       Console.WriteLine(""THE END.""); 
    }

    }
  }

by the way, I’ve been commenting out portions of the code to try to figure out what specific line is causing this to break.




 synapps1:

    if (upperDoorChoice == ""KNOCK"")
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""A voice behind the door speaks. It says Answer this riddle:"");
      Console.WriteLine(""Poor people have it. Rich people need it. If you eat it you die. What is it?"");
      Console.WriteLine(""Type your answer:"");
      string riddleAnswer = Console.ReadLine(); // you can chain these methods, and make your code more concise like this: Console.ReadLine().ToUpper()
      string upperCaseRiddle = riddleAnswer.ToUpper();// no need for lines like this if you chain your Console.ReadLine().ToUpper() methods
      //Your if (riddleAnswer == ""NOTHING"") { } goes here inside the existing if (doorChoice == ""KNOCK"") { } code block
    }



You need to nest the if() statement, and its code block inside the code block for the user having chosen ‘KNOCK’. See my comments to your code above.
Your basic structure will look similar to this:
if (doorChoice == ""KNOCK"")
{
  //do stuff
  //get user input
  if (riddleAnswer == ""NOTHING"")
  {
    //do stuff
  }
  else
  {
    //do other stuff
  }
}
else if (doorChoice == ""OPEN"")
{
  //do other stuff
}

Also, you can chain methods together to eliminate the need for extra variables and lines of code like so:
string noiseChoice = Console.ReadLine().ToUpper();
Hope this helps!

Incredibly helpful! Thank you so much. I was able to get everything cleaned up and working correctly thanks to your help.

                }

            }


","
You don’t need an if statement to print the output you are looking for. Inside your for loop you only need a Console.WriteLine(); statement. j is going to start at 0, and increase in value by 1 each time the code inside its block { } executes, so you should use j as the index for your for your arrays instead of 0. Using 0, you are accessing the first element of each array every time the code executes.

Thanks for your feedback. I tried that already but i did not print out the way i wanted to. I want it to print out a one sentence for each string. like- “ The main color of grapes is purple.” then “The main color of apples is red.” and so on.

The way I’ve described it will do exactly that. Your code should resemble this. You’ll have to substitute in your variable names, and array values.
string[] letters = new string[] {""A"", ""B"", ""C""};
string[] foods = new string[] {""apple"", ""banana"", ""carrot""};

for (int i = 0; i < letters.Length; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine(letters[i] + "" is for "" + foods[i] + ""."");
}

Output:

A is for apple.
B is for banana.
C is for carrot.

Happy coding!

Appreciate your help!

Without the Console.ReadLine(), the console isn’t waiting for a response from you, so you are typing commands straight into the bash console.

Thanks a million mate.

I now have another problem.

This is the code:
using System;

  Console.WriteLine(""You're sitting in your room and hear a noise coming from down the hall."");
  Console.WriteLine(""Do you go investigate?"");
  Console.Write(""Type YES or NO: "");
  string noiseChoice = Console.ReadLine().ToUpper();
  string firstChoice = Console.ReadLine();
    if (firstChoice == ""NO"")
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""Not much of an adventure if we don't leave our room!"");
      Console.WriteLine(""THE END."");
    }
    else if (firstChoice == ""YES"")
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""You walk into the hallway and see a light coming from under a door down the hall."");
      Console.WriteLine(""You walk towards it. Do you open it or knock?"");
    }
  Console.Write(""Type OPEN or KNOCK: "");
  string doorChoice = Console.ReadLine().ToUpper();
}

}
}




 trk075:

  Console.Write(""Type YES or NO: "");
  string noiseChoice = Console.ReadLine().ToUpper(); //either rename this variable firstChoice
  string firstChoice = Console.ReadLine(); // this line needs to be deleted. you already have the input
    if (firstChoice == ""NO"") //'OR' make this noiseChoice
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""Not much of an adventure if we don't leave our room!"");
      Console.WriteLine(""THE END."");
    }
    else if (firstChoice == ""YES"") //'AND' this noiseChoice
    {
      Console.WriteLine(""You walk into the hallway and see a light coming from under a door down the hall."");
      Console.WriteLine(""You walk towards it. Do you open it or knock?"");
    }



You assigned the user’s input to noiseChoice already. This line string firstChoice = Console.ReadLine(); is expecting what exactly?
Your if() statements need to use the same variable that the user’s input was assigned to which was noiseChoice. If you’d rather call the variable firstChoice, you need to change the original assignment from the user’s input to firstChoice as well. Hopefully that made sense.

Thanks. I’m starting to think of trusting you rather than trusting the hints that I get.

A lot of times the ‘hints’ give us a general idea of how to complete the step, but not the exact code. Look to the instructions for things like variable names and other specifics. Use the hints if you aren’t sure what to do, or how to do it, but don’t copy them exactly. Occasionally the hint will provide an exact solution, but usually it’s more of a pattern to follow.

81,How to make a UI for a C# program?,"Get Help,Git",,2,"
Hey!
I have nearly completed the C# course and have an idea of a program I’d like to make.
It will allow users to enter items they purchase, the price they buy for and the price they sell for.
I understand the “BackEnd” kind of stuff but how would I go about making a UI?
","
I learned C# through Microsoft Virtual Academy. You can make simple console applications, but if you want a nice UI, you’ll need to create it with XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language). The only way I know of is to use Visual Studio not VS Code, but Visual Studio. There may be other IDE’s, but Visual Studio makes it easy to create apps that integrate C# and XAML. Check this out: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/designers/designing-xaml-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019
XAML is very similar to HTML, and using XAML with C# for Windows apps is similar to using HTML and JavaScript for web apps. Hope this helps!

I am trying to do the first step. It wants me to create variables that account for all uppercase letters, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
I’m not sure if I’m supposed to just type all those options or not. It seems like there must be an easier way right?
Please help!

Yes. You need to type all the possibilities for each variable. For example:
string uppercase = ""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"";
Keep in mind that this project isn’t checking your code at each step with a SCT, so you have some leeway with the special characters. You can have as many or as few as you want.
Happy coding!

Why does my code run forever?

Hello @sxjosh,
When we click on the link we will only go to the lesson. We can’t see the code you have created.
Could you add/post your code so we can have a look ?  You can use the </>  button to format the code correctly.

84,Help) float and doubles in C#,"Get Help,Git",,2,"
I was following the Learn C# course on codeacademy and I have a question about float and double in C#
Course Problem`
Next, create a variable to hold the weight. Name the variable  weight  and store the value  65.22 .

List item

using System;

namespace Form
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // Create Variables
			string name = ""Shadow"";
      string breed = ""Golden Retriever"";
      int age = 5;
      float weight = 65.22;

      // Print variables to the console



    }
  }
}


I tried to actually declare the weight variable as a float initially and came upon an error message:
Program.cs(13,22): error CS0664: Literal of type double cannot be implicitly converted to type 'float'; use an 'F' suffix to create a literal of this type [/home/ccuser/workspace/csharp-data-types-variables-creating-variables-c-sharp/e7-workspace.csproj]

The build failed. Please fix the build errors and run again.

I thought double was an unnecessary declaration here because the number is small and float is supposed to accept decimal numbers as its value;
Initially I thought putting the ‘F’ or ‘f’ suffix would solve the problem but
Step#3 of the lesson:
“3.Next, create a variable to hold the weight. Name the variable weight and store the value 65.22.”
Still gave me an error msg: “Did you define a double named weight with the value 65.22?”
So is this only because of how this lesson is set up or am I not able to declare “65.22” as a float?
If 65.22 is not in the allowed range, what are some rules I could refer to when creating variables rather than having the range (+/-3.4 * 10^38)?

To declare a float with a value you have to write it as:
float weight = 65.22f;
I think the lesson wants you to use a double specifically.
