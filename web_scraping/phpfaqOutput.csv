Hi!
In this lesson, the order of operators is described, but the Modulo operator (%) isn’t mentioned. The order explained is:

()
**

* and /


+ and -


I suppose the modulo operator is at number 2, next to exponentiation, but want to make sure.
Thanks!

It’s actually at number 3 on your list. It’s basically treated like / but returns the remainder instead of the quotient.

Ok, thank you for clearing that out!

Definitely bookmark this page for easy reference. Until this stuff is cemented in our minds, it can never hurt to double check.

https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.precedence.php

When two operators have equal precedence, association is left to right. This can have a bearing on the result so order of placement becomes the precedence determiner.
 > 10 % 3 / 4
<- 0.25
 > 10 / 4 % 3
<- 2.5
 > 10 % 3 * 4
<- 4
 > 10 * 4 % 3
<- 1
 > 

Times and powers are not equal precedence so can be written however they occur without changing the result.
 > 2 ** 2 * 4
<- 16
 > 4 * 2 ** 2
<- 16
 > 


Totally off topic and different language, but the gist is the same.
>>> list(map(lambda x: 10 / x % 3, range(1, 10)))
[1.0, 2.0, 0.3333333333333335, 2.5, 2.0, 1.6666666666666667, 1.4285714285714286, 1.25, 1.1111111111111112]
>>> list(map(lambda x: 10 % 3 / x, range(1, 10)))
[1.0, 0.5, 0.3333333333333333, 0.25, 0.2, 0.16666666666666666, 0.14285714285714285, 0.125, 0.1111111111111111]
>>> 

Note the relationship between corresponding terms in each list. I’d love to see these two graphs plotted if there are any matplotlib savvy learners. Apologize for bringing Python into the mix, but it is more for convenience. The point is the relation between these two graphs, which is what I found kind of interesting, nothing to do with the OP, save the illustration of precendence with two curves.

I thought I understood the concept of By Reference, but the following code example confuses me.
<?php
/* Imagine a lot of code here */  
  $very_bad_unclear_name = ""15 chicken wings"";

// Write your code here:
	$order =& $very_bad_unclear_name;
	$order .= "", 20 drumsticks"";
 
// Don't change the line below
  echo ""\nYour order is: $very_bad_unclear_name."";

The result of the echo statement is: “Your order is: 15 chicken wings, 20 drumsticks”; but I would expect the result to be “Your order is: 15 chicken wings”.
As described in the lesson:

When we  assign by reference  we’re saying that the variable on the left of the operator should point, or  refer , to the exact same data as the variable on the right.

After all, we are assigning
$order =& $very_bad_unclear_name,
and not
$very_bad_unclear_name =& $order.
So how does assigning or reassigning anything by reference to the $order variable affect the contents of the $very_bad_unclear_name variable?




 skrantzman:

As described in the lesson:

When we assign by reference we’re saying that the variable on the left of the operator should point, or refer , to the exact same data as the variable on the right.



Here is the whole paragraph you qouted:

When we assign by reference we’re saying that the variable on the left of the operator should point, or refer , to the exact same data as the variable on the right. With assignment by reference, changes made to one variable will affect the other

I added the boldface for emphasis. Essentially you are giving the variable in question an alias when you assign another variable by reference. Using either name in any operation affects both variables. The variables are like labels for the actual data. If the data were in a drawer, and then you came along and labelled the drawer drawer_A, and after that I added an additional label to the same drawer calling it drawer_1, either of us could use either label name to refer someone to the same drawer.

@midlindner - Thanks, that makes sense.
In other languages, I have always used By Reference in a way that mirrors the example given in the lecture code, i.e. you want the reassignment reflected further down in the code, not the original assignment.
$first_player_rank = ""Beginner"";
$second_player_rank =& $first_player_rank; 
echo $second_player_rank; // Prints: Beginner

$first_player_rank = ""Intermediate""; // Reassign the value of $first_player_rank
echo $second_player_rank; // Prints: Intermediate

I never realized that By Reference changed both variables until I came across the exercise code I posted above.  I am glad I decided to go through this course as a refresher to PHP, as I learned something new!

without this command =& does the .= command have any value?

= is the assignment operator, so the variable on the left side would be assigned the value on the right side. Consider:
$a = 1;
$b = $a;
$a = 2;
echo $b; //prints 1

$b =& $a;
$a = 5;
echo $b; //prints 5

Hope this helps.

14,What about it?,"Get Help,Git",,1,"
Instructions- Read It carefully**(I got a null result)**
1.
We’re going to do a mathematical “magic” trick. Create a variable,  $my_num  and assign as its value any number.
Next, create a second variable,  $answer  and assign  $my_num  as its value.
Stuck? Get a hint
2.
Use the addition assignment operator to add 2 to  $answer .
Hint
The point here is to practice using the handy mathematical assignment operators:
$example += 9;
3.
Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply  $answer  by 2.
Stuck? Get a hint
4.
Use the subtraction assignment operator to subtract 2 from  $answer .
Stuck? Get a hint
5.
Use the division assignment operator to divide  $answer  by 2.
Stuck? Get a hint
6.
Almost there. Use the subtraction assignment operator to subtract your original number ( $my_num ) from  $answer . Finally, use  echo  to print  $answer  to the terminal.
If everything went as it should,  $answer  should be 1. No matter what your original number was! Don’t belive us? Go ahead try it with a different number for the value of  $my_num .
Here my code,
<?php
// Write your code below:

  $my_num=100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000;

  $answer=$my_num;
  $answer+=2;
$answer*=2;
$answer-=2;
$answer/=2;

Just curious,
I see that in every example given for printing multiple lines of text, it is formatted like this:
function greetLearner()
{
  echo ""Hello, Learner!\n"";
  echo ""I hope you're enjoying PHP!\n"";
  echo ""Love, Codecademy"";
}

I tried formatting it like this:
function greetLearner()
{
  echo ""Hello, Learner!\n hope you're enjoying PHP!\nLove, Codecademy"";
}

There was no difference in how it printed. Is one method better than the other, and if so, why?
Thanks!

I’d say it’s a matter of preference. The first example may be slightly more readable, but as long as you know what \n means, the second example is pretty readable too. Just an aside, this would work too because if you hit the enter/return key in the middle of a string, you get a new line:
function greetLearner()
{
  echo ""Hello, Learner!
I hope you're enjoying PHP!
Love, Codecademy"";
}

Happy coding!

Aside
echo is simple by all appearances but in reality it is a very expensive operation, or at least it used to be. We can build huge strings in PHP and then echo only once. Something to keep in mind when writing generation code.

Makes sense; thank you!

OK, now I’m going to research this!
As soon as I’m done researching Mac OS X vs. Linux, that is…
Codecademy has created a monster!

Out of curiosity, why does the assignment of a function to a variable output the echoed string inside the function?
I understand functions, how they work, why they’re used, etc. I just don’t follow why the sheer act of assigning it to a variable triggers the echoed string. You’d think that, like the return value, the string would only show when you called the function.
Could someone shed some light on that for me? Thanks!

As this question has remained unanswered for the past month, it deserves further investigation, so I re-upped your post.
Please post a link to the exercise in question, in a reply, and we can attempt to get to the bottom of this. Thanks.

I have the same question  Could somebody explain please?

Let’s start with a link to the exercise, please.

The exercise in question is: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-php/lessons/introduction-to-php-functions/exercises/using-return-statements?action=resume_content_item
Ex:
function printNumberReturnString()
{
echo 18;
return “eighteen”;
}
$my_num = printNumberReturnString();
echo $my_num;
And it displays: 18eighteen




 atitienei:

And it displays: 18eighteen


echo does not include a newline, so the pencil stays where it last ended.

SERP: php echo newline


I am also wondering the same.  Not why the string and return are not separate, but why they are showing up for seemingly different reasons.  The return is being printed because it was brought forth with the echo command, but the string was somehow printed just by declaring the function as a variable.  I haven’t seen anything print just from it being declared thus far.  Why is it able to do that?  Thanks!

I have the same question when (half way through this exercise) I run:

function printStringReturnNumber()
{
echo ""Next birthday you will be "";
return 42;
}
$my_num =  printStringReturnNumber();

“Next birthday you will be” is displayed. However at no point in the code do I invoke the function printStringReturnNumber() so why is anything printed at all?




 bit4020088114:

at no point in the code do I invoke the function printStringReturnNumber()


It is invoked as the right side of the assignment is evaluated and the outcome assigned. Since it is invoked, the echo action takes place, and $my_num will now be 42.

Got it - Thanks.
In defining $my_num the function is invoked. This becomes clearer in the following exercises…

Just a silly question on newlines. Is there a specific reason to put the newline ON the new line, instead of putting the newline on the previous line?
Example from the instructions:
echo “1. [Thing to do]”;
echo “\n2. [Another thing to do]”;
echo “\n3. Learn to have “fun””;
Different example:
echo “1. [Thing to do]\n”;
echo “2. [Another thing to do]\n”;
echo “3. Learn to have “fun””;
I get the same result, but I am curious as to why (or if) you would od one over the other.

Why do we need to use braces here?

what i didn’t understand that how the statment ($result = returnNothing(); ) Prints: I’m running! I’m running!
i mean… where is the echo statment we just define ($result) and assign the value to it but there is no echo or somthing else.

Hello, @majendy, and welcome to the forum. I believe this example code is what you’re referring to:
function returnNothing() 
{
  echo ""I'm running! I'm running!\n"";
}

$result = returnNothing(); // Prints: I'm running! I'm running!

echo $result; // Nothing is printed

The function returnNothing() has an echo statement in it’s code body. Any time returnNothing() is called, the echo ""I'm running! I'm running!\n""; is executed. The $result variable is assigned the return value of the function. The function has no return value, so $result = NULL. We could add a return statement to the function if we wanted to, and that value would be assigned to $result, and then the last line of code: echo $result would print that value.
Like this for example:
function returnNothing() 
{
  echo ""I'm running! I'm running!\n""; //prints ""I'm running! I'm running!"" when the function is called
  return ""Okay. I'm finished running.\n""; //returns ""Okay. I'm finished running.\n"" to the line of code that called the function.
}

$result = returnNothing(); // calls the function, the return value is assigned to $result

echo $result; //  prints the value assigned to $result

Output:

I’m running! I’m running!
Okay. I’m finished running.

Hope this helps!

ohh yes that was helpful thx for your answer

Hi, I am not getting this, I am doing everything as per example:
<?php

// Write your code below:
function createVacuum() {
  echo ""I have created a vacuuum"";
  
} 
$result = createVacuum();
echo $result;
  
echo createVacuum() * 10;

IT PRINTS:
I have created a vacuuumI have created a vacuuum0
The second should not print 0 and the third 10 zeros?

Hello, @tuzso.
Your code includes 2 calls to your createVacuum() function. Inside the function you echo the string, ""I have created a vacuuum"". You call the function the first time here:
 $result = createVacuum();

Since the function is called, “I have created a vacuuum” is printed. That accounts for the first part of your output.
Next, you echo $result. What value was assigned to $result? Answer: NULL Since createVacuum() has no return value, NULL is returned. When we echo NULL nothing is printed, so you still have just “I have created a vacuuum” as your output.
Then, you have this line:
echo createVacuum() * 10;

createVacuum() is again called, so its echo statement is executed, and “I have created a vacuuum” is once again printed. Now your output looks like this:

I have created a vacuuumI have created a vacuuum

After the function is finished executing it once again returns NULL, so your line of code is essentially now this:
echo NULL * 10; //since NULL is the return value of createVacuum()

That expression evaluates to 0, so 0 is printed which gives you your final output:

I have created a vacuuumI have created a vacuuum0

I took the liberty of editing your post so that the code would display properly. For future posts please see How do I format code in my posts?

Array to string conversion notice can be fixed by adding
error_reporting(0);

to your code.
When you echo the Array it’s giving you a notice or warning that you’re converting an Array to a string which is exactly what the lesson is asking for. However, the lesson interpreter thinks there’s an error so it’s not letting you continue. If you turn off the error handling the lesson lets you continue.

Why does the terminal returns “GOLD!1”?
<?php
namespace Codecademy;


$treasure_hunt = [""garbage"", ""cat"", 99, [""soda can"", 8, "":)"", ""sludge"", [""stuff"", ""lint"", [""GOLD!""], ""cave"", ""bat"", ""scorpion""], ""rock""], ""glitter"", ""moonlight"", 2.11];
  
// Write your code below:

echo print_r($treasure_hunt[3][4][2][0]);
                  


The reason it is printing the 1 at the end is because of how print_r works.
What print_r does is it echos the value and returns whether that value exists or not. When something is true, it is evaluated to 1, and when something is false, it evaluates to 0. So what is happening in the code above is that print_r is echoing GOLD! to the console and then you are echoing the returned value of print_r, which is 1 because that statement evaluates to true.
I hope I have explained this okay, took me a while to understand it.
write print_r($treasure_hunt[3][4][3][0]); and see that it outputs just GOLD! and not the one, that is because print_r is echoing the string, and returning the value of whether it is true or not.

Hi, so I took PHP a while back, but a lot of it never really stuck.
I remember something about “$variable = value” versus “$variable == value” and that you should never, never, never confuse the two…but I can’t remember why.
Does anybody have an explanation of this for me?
Thanks!

Assignment versus comparison.
$a = 42
$b = '42'
$a == $b     // true (after type juggling)
$a === $b    // false (not identical)


https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.php


Perfect. That makes sense. Thank you!

What is the reason for using echo twice? Wouldn’t it be easier and use less code to concatenate it together?
Instead of this:
<?php
// Write your code below:
  
  $name = ""Tom Smith"";
  $language = ""Russian"";

  echo ""My name is "" . $name . "" and I have an awesome dog named Mojo"" . ""."";
  echo ""\nMojo speaks "" . $language . ""."";

Do this:
<?php
// Write your code below:
  
  $name = ""Tom Smith"";
  $language = ""Russian"";

  echo ""My name is "" . $name . "" and I have an awesome dog named Mojo"" . ""."" . ""\nMojo speaks "" . $language . ""."";

Thank you

Welcome, @py2490724253,
Good question. Either approach is valid, but you are right to look for ways to simplify the code and reduce repetition.
Something to know about double quoted strings in PHP… They support interpolation, so concatenation is not necessary. The same cannot be said for single quoted strings. They do not support interpolation.
echo ""My name is $name and I have an awesome dog named Mojo.\nMojo speaks $language."";

On a technical note, echo is rather a complex process for the server to handle and can use a lot of resources. Composing an entire document into one large string is permitted. We can output it (write it to the request document) with a single echo statement.

Thanks! And thanks for the tech note on echo. That helps. After I went to the next lesson I saw what you are describing.

Hi, I am lost here, where does the ($person_arr) come from in function calculateAge?
Shoud it not be  $about _me?
function calculateAge ($person_arr){
  $current_year = date(""Y"");
  $age = $current_year - $person_arr[""birth_year""];
  return $age;
}
?>
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>About me:</h2>
<?php   
  echo ""<h3>Hello! I'm {$about_me[""name""]}!</h3>"";
  echo ""<p> I'm "" . calculateAge($about_me). "" years old! That's pretty cool, right?</p>"";
  echo ""<div>What more is there to say? I love {$about_me[""favorite_food""]}, and that's pretty much it!</div>"";


$person_arr is the parameter, it will receive a value when you call the function. So you pass the value of $about_me to the function
lets say you also have a variable called $about_you, you could do:
calculateAge($about_you)

to calculate your age (instead of my age).
That makes function useful, we can reuse them

I am a little confused with the syntax in the example vs in the hint…
In the text introduction the placement of the {} around the variable is done after the ...
//echo ""<>Your lucky number is {lucky_number}</>
// return “<>Hello, ${name}!</>”
However in the hints and what seems to work the {} are around the $…
//echo “<>My favorite color is {$data[‘color’]}.</>”;
Which is correct? Or is there a subtle difference in use that I am not seeing? HTML tags partially omitted for clarity.
Thanks

I am looking for a php web development company anyone please contact me.

In the very first task there isnt really anything to do, but I tried uploaded the file to my server and noticed something strange, the html code made through php shows the ending part ;?> in the browser, ie:
<?php echo ""But this code is interpreted by PHP and turned into HTML"";?>
shows:

But this code is interpreted by PHP and turned into HTML
;?>

If I remove the ending part “;?>” it works as intended, but that code won’t run in the codepen learning environment.
Can anyone explain what’s going on?

Possibly Pratik’s post in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30084418/php-closing-tag-showing-what-am-i-doing-wrong may offer an explanation for what you are seeing.

So… I am having issues getting through PHP Form Validation… I don’t know what happened to the program for this lesson. I keep getting this error even though I’m only adding two (very simple) new lines of code:
“{“errors”:[{“detail”:“session not found”}]}”

Seems related to codecademy servers, i see multiple topics mentioning this problem

What is the difference between identical (===) and equal (==) operators? In the exercise, it is said that the equal operator is less strict, and I want to figure out its usage comparing to the identical operator.

$a == $b   Equal      TRUE if $a is equal to $b after type juggling.
$a === $b  Identical  TRUE if $a is equal to $b, and they are of the same type. 

An example
var_dump(1 == ""1"");   => true
var_dump(1 === ""1"");  => false


If you compare a number with a string or the comparison involves numerical strings, then each string is converted to a number and the comparison performed numerically.
The type conversion does not take place when the comparison is === or !== as this involves comparing the type as well as the value.

Hi everyone!
I’m sort of got stuck. Either this or there is some error, as the topic is quite easy.
Task 3 about concatenating four strings  ""\n"" ,  ""tur"" ,  ""duck"" , and  ""en""
I put the semicolon at the end. Used another \ before \n so that the system would perceive it as a string and of course added three points between them. The result ‘Did you print the four strings concatenated?’ Yep, definitely. I used different options: with additional spaces like this ’ ', with spaces before and after strings, without spaces, with commas between strings. So I would highly appreciate it if anyone could give me a hint about what I’m doing wrong?

Hi there, welcome to the forum.
Could we maybe see some code?
A link to the exercise would be helpful as well 

Sure, no problem! Could have guessed) I’m just not a very ‘forum’ person )
echo ""\n "" . ""tur "" . ""duck "" . “en”;
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-php/lessons/php-strings-and-variables/exercises/string-concatenation

Alright, I see
With what you’re doing, we’re printing this:
tur duck en
What we really want, though, is
 turducken
Why could that be?

Edit: my bad, you did try that, didn’t you…

One thing I notice, while pasting your code, is this:

If you’re also getting this, then it’s due to the quotes around en.
If you’re not getting that, then I’m not entirely sure.

Thank you.) That hepled ) I just misunderstood the task.
I thought, that I should have made \n to be perceived as a text and be printed together with other strings, hence I added another backslash. I got the result I wanted, but it wasn’t right )

The quotes around en were fine in the code. I guess it changed automatically, when I pasted it here.
But in the next codings I’ll be careful with quotes as well.
Thanks ))

Yeah then it’s probably just due to the forum formatting them that way.
Alright, glad you could solve this. Keep going!

I will! Thank you!

In the third code snippet on Numerical Keys under Associative Arrays, why does echo $num_array[1001] print New Element in $num_array, since there’s no previous key 1001 previously declared i don’t see how it’s possible.

The third snippet is:
$num_array = [1000 => ""one thousand"", 100 => ""one hundred"", 600 => ""six hundred""];
$num_array[] = ""New Element in \$num_array"";
echo $num_array[1001]; // Prints: New Element in $num_array

$num_array is an associative array with integer keys (instead of string keys).
The largest key used is 1000. Then, we append a string to the array. We haven’t explicitly specified any integer or string key for this new element. But, there should be some way to access this element. If there is no key specified for an element, we should still be able to access the element by its index.
The largest integer key used in the array was 1000. The new element’s key or index will be one more than the largest integer used. So when we append the new string element “New Element in $num_array”, the element is assigned the index (or integer key) of 1001.

For Instruction 2 (the second task), the answer displays as 5 but I see the word ‘obvious’ in $essay_two 6 times. This is very confusing.

Simply because the first obvious, being capitalized, isn’t recognized.
""Obvious"" != ""obvious""

Great thanks for that explanation. Makes sense, but they should have explained that in the topic.

Could someone explain why this is not an acceptable answer to this exercise?
function whatRelation($percentage)
{
if ($percentage === 100) {
echo “identical twins”;
} elseif ($percentage < 100) {
echo “parent and child or full siblings”;
} elseif ($percentage < 35) {
echo “grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings”;
} elseif ($percentage < 14) {
echo “first cousins”;
} elseif ($percentage < 6) {
echo “second cousins”;
} elseif ($percentage < 3) {
echo “third cousins”;
} elseif ($percentage < 1) {
echo “not genetically related”;
}
}
Cheers!

Suppose the percentage of shared DNA is 12. According to the specifications, this should result in a statement of “first cousins”. But, this is not what will be printed if you use the code suggested by you.
The first if condition ($percentage === 100) will be FALSE, so the next condition will be checked.
The second condition ($percentage < 100) will be TRUE because indeed 12 is less than 100. So, the wrong message “parent and child or full siblings” will be printed.
You don’t need the elseif ($percentage < 100) condition. But even after deleting this particular condition, the other conditions also result in flawed logic. Instead consider using conditions involving the > or >= operator. That will help you in capturing the correct behavior.

My only comment to fellow noobs, Google is your friend. Personally, I don’t believe the program did the best job explaining the syntax of custom functions. As a result, it took some experimenting to understand passing an argument, calling aforementioned argument and finally the use of return. However, I am not complaining because I imagine this is what much of coding is.

I second this. The requirements on the first exercise are misleading.

Hi the correct answer as far as I can see for this question is:
function ternaryCheckout($items)
{
$items <= 12 ? “express lane” : “regular lane”;
}
But the course is throwing up the error:
Your function should return a string. We tested your function and expected a string return value but instead it returned a value of type NULL
What am I doing wrong here? is it an issue with my syntax? Or a bug with the course itself?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
James

Hey James, welcome to the forums.
The error is right, right now your function is not returning anything.
Consider the following:
function sayHello() {
  ""Hello"";
}

echo sayHello();

As it is, “Hello” wouldn’t be printed. Because it’s not being returned from inside the function.
Sure, you could write it like this:
function sayHello() {
  echo ""Hello"";
}

sayHello();

But what we really want is a return statement, in this case.

Thank you. My confusion arose from the fact hat I thought the “return” was included in the ternary operator.

Hello,
I’m a bit confused about
!10 < 11; // Evaluates to: TRUE
!(10 < 11);  // Evaluates to: FALSE

in the explanations.  I think understand the 2nd line. (10<11) is TRUE, so !(TRUE) is FALSE.
But how does the first line !10<11 evaluate to TRUE?
I do understand that the point of the examples was to show that “The not operator has very high operator precedence; be sure to use parentheses so that code evaluation happens as intended:” and that we should use parentheses like the 2nd line…
Thanks in advance!

As you correctly stated !(10 < 11); evaluates to FALSE because the comparison between the two integers 10 < 11 results in TRUE and therefore !(TRUE) evaluates to FALSE.
I think the statement !10 < 11; has to do with the NOT operator as well as type juggling. If we look at the documentation for comparison operators, the description for the less than operator mentions type juggling (if necessary).
The statement !10 < 11; can be thought of as (!10) < 11;.
10 is an integer. When we apply the NOT operator to the integer 10, we expect a boolean result. 10 is truthy (see the previous lesson https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-php/lessons/booleans-and-comparison-operators/exercises/truthy-and-falsy), so !10 results in !(TRUE) i.e. FALSE.
This means the statement  !10 < 11; becomes FALSE < 11;. Since we have a comparison between a boolean type and an integer type, so type juggling happens. A boolean TRUE is juggled as the integer 1 while the boolean FALSE is juggled as the integer 0.
Therefore, the comparison  FALSE < 11; becomes 0 < 11; (after type juggling) which evaluates to TRUE.

Wouldn’t the solution to this be wrong? I wrote this out:
<?php
namespace Codecademy;

function calculateCircleArea($diameter){
  $pi = pi();
  return $pi * $diameter ** 2;
}

echo calculateCircleArea(30);

If you go online and search “pi area calculator” and put in the values you provided in the excerise it doesn’t match up.

Remember that to find the area of a circle we need 2 things; pi, and the radius of the circle, not the diameter.
So what is happening in your calculation is that you are using the diameter and then squaring that, which will give you the wrong value.
Remember that a radius is half of a diameter, and so you need to halve the diameter first.
So you would need to do a calculation like this:
  function calculateCircleArea($diameter) {
    $radius_sq = ($diameter * 0.5) ** 2;
    $pi = pi();
    return $pi * $radius_sq . ""\n"";
  }

echo calculateCircleArea(25);
echo calculateCircleArea(30);


Why does it force me to use the ceil() function when I can just use the round() function to do the same thing?

The round and ceil functions aren’t interchangeable. The ceil function rounds fractions up, while the round function rounds a float to the closest integer.
Consider the example tipGenerously(66.18). If we add a 20% tip, the new total is 79.416.
If we round this i.e. round(79.416), we get 79 because 79.416 is more closer to the integer 79 than the integer 80. Contrast this with ceil(79.416) which results in 80. The motivation behind using ceil instead of round for calculating the total cost is that we are willing to pay a slight bit extra to ensure that the tip is 20%. If we round the total instead, then there is a chance that the tip may be a shade below 20%. So, we are willing to pay a few extra cents if necessary, but we don’t want to shortchange even by a few cents.

Open  greet_user.php  and replace - How to open a file?
!–Add code here--  - Where is it?
No solution!

There is a tab “greet_user.php” next to “index.php”.

second Instructions, am i doing something wrong?
2.
Open greet_user.php and replace
with the user’s name. Use the PHP shorthand for echo within HTML ( <?= ).
Be sure to use the $_GET superglobal.
You should concatenate (using PHP’s . operator) the user’s first name with a space ( "" "" ) and then the user’s last name.
my code in greet_user.php: 
Thanks!
Your name has been recorded as:
 <?=$_GET[""first""] . "" "" . $_GET[""last""];?> 
Reset
when i fill the form and click submit i see my name on greet_user.php, but i got error message: Did you modify the code in greet_user.php to print the user’s first name concatenated with their last ? The data should be coming from the $_GET superglobal.

Well, this appears to be correct, although you don’t need a semicolon when using the short echo tags.
You could simply write:
<?=$_GET['first'] . "" "" . $_GET['last']?>

It’s fixed, thank you so much!

I have to admit, I was totally thrown by this aspect of question 1: “and the first letter in the input is NOT the correct letter”.
Should it have been obvious that accessing a particular character within a string is done using something like $string[0]? I know previous lessons have demonstrated that you can access values within arrays using indexes, but I can’t recall one that showed that it’s possible with a non-array variable.
I totally understand it now, but not sure if this should have been something I picked up on immediately.

The code in this exercise (and all subsequent) does not seem to work in the real world.
This is specifically what I’m having trouble with
<input type=“text” id=“c-word” name=“c-word” value=<?=$_POST[""c-word""]?>>
I get an undefined index error when I try and use a value=<?=$_POST[""input-name""]?>
I copied the code from this exercise into my environment and tried to run it and it does not work like it does here in the Codecademy environment.
So how is this supposed to work in a real environment?

Hey there, @miq_noatum_it. Welcome to the forums!
This happens when you try to access a variable that has no value assigned to it.
You can either declare your variable, or use the Null coalescing operator (compatible with PHP 7.x). It returns its first operand if it exists and is not NULL ; otherwise it returns the second.
<?= $_POST['c-word'] ?? '' ?>

If you echo gettype($_POST['c-word']);, you’d see that it’s NULL. Therefore the second operand of the Null coalescing operator will be returned which, in this case, is an empty string.
No more error.

Ok so far so good, no error but when I submit an incorrect email (for example) I get my verbiage saying that the email is invalid but it then clears the form. I thought the whole point of doing the value= thing was to keep the fields filled out if the email field failed validation.

Very basic example to illustrate how you can achieve this:
<?php

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
  if (! filter_var($_POST['email'], FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
    $email_error = 'This is not a valid email address';
    $email = $_POST['email'];
  }
}

?>

<form method=""post"">
  <input name=""email"" value=""<?= $email ?? '' ?>"">
  <span><?= $email_error ?? '' ?></span>
  <input type=""submit"">
</form>

On error, you’d send back an error message as well as the value provided by the email input field.

Alright, getting better. But what about all the other data in the form fields that aren’t email. Like names, job titles, manager names, check boxes, radio buttons…? Those all get reset. Do I have a script like the above for all form fields?

It’s basically the same idea for most form fields, yeah. Just different validation.
For check boxes and radio buttons, you’ll have to do some digging to figure out how they work.

Thanks for all that. They way you laid out makes more sense though. The $_POST isn’t defined when the form is first loaded.
I’m a little disappointed that they left all of that out of the lesson. Seems like it should be included.

Any suggestion why it doesnt accept my code?
The code works, but still getting an arror at point 2.
   <form method=""post"" action="""">
Enter a word that starts with the letter ""a"":
<br>
<input type=""text"" name=""a-word"" id=""a-word"" value=""<?= $_POST[""a-word""]; ?>"">
<br>      
  <p class=""error"" id=""a-error""> 
  <?= checkWord($_POST[""a-word""],""a"");  ?>
  </p>
<br>     
Enter a word that starts with the letter ""b"":
<br>
<input type=""text"" id=""b-word"" name=""b-word""
value=""<?=$_POST[""b-word""]; ?>"">
<br>      
     <p class=""error"" id=""b-error""> 
  <?= checkWord($_POST[""b-word""],""b""); ?>
  </p>
<br>
Enter a word that starts with the letter ""c"":
<br>
<input type=""text"" id=""c-word"" name=""c-word""
value=""<?=$_POST[""c-word""]; ?>"">
<br>      
     <p class=""error"" id=""c-error""> 
  <?=checkWord($_POST[""c-word""],""c""); ?>
  </p>

Hey,
I don’t see anything particularly wrong, but the exercise checks might expect something specific.
I’d try writing it this way, as one line:
<p class=""error"" id=""a-error""><?= checkWord($_POST[""a-word""],""a""); ?></p>

Also, put a space here
<?=checkWord($_POST[""c-word""],""c""); ?>
   ^


Thank you. That’s why I stopped using Codecademy some month ago. It’s so annoying. They should check results and not formatting. Anyway, its still my favorite site to learn new languages…

The error code when inputting this code is incorrect. It says “The result of calling getInfo doesn’t quite match what we provided.” The issue, however, wasn’t within the getInfo() method. It was the period that I erroneously placed at the beginning of the second sentence, in order to end the first. The error should read something like “That’s not quite what it should say,” or something similar. I was breaking my brain trying to figure out what was wrong with getInfo().
<?php
class Beverage {
  public $temperature;

  function getInfo() {
    return ""This beverage is $this->temperature."";
  }
}

class Milk extends Beverage {
  function __construct() {
    $this->temperature = ""cold"";
  }

  function getInfo() {
    return parent::getInfo() . "". I like my milk this way."";
  }
}
        
I think that your problem is only the period in the string “. I like my…”, without the period your code is good.
class Beverage
{
    public $temperature;

    function getInfo()
    {
        return ""This beverage is $this->temperature."";
    }
}

class Milk extends Beverage
{
    function __construct()
    {
        $this->temperature = ""cold"";
    }
    function getInfo()
    {
        return parent::getInfo() . "" I like my milk this way."";
    }
}

$milk = new Milk();
echo $milk->getInfo();


I thought overloading is when we define two or more functions with the same name but they each have a different set of parameters. But in the Beverage and Milk class the method getInfo() both have no parameters. Wouldn’t this be considered overriding and not overloading?

Yes, you could be considering it like an overriding or maybe (IMHO) could be also considering it like an overwriting, because first you go to create a method in a main class and after you go to overwrite the same method in the subclass.

I think you are correct. The exercise seems to be an example of overriding instead of overloading.

So I was wondering why php code starts with <?php and ends with ?>.
Why the question mark? Wouldn’t it just look better without it, so why add it? Is there a specific reason for this?

So I was wondering why php code starts with <?php and ends with ?>.


Rasmus Lerdorf on implementing the first version of PHP “I wrote a very simple parser that would pick tags out of HTML files and replace them with the output of the corresponding functions in the C library.”

Is there a reason why there is a question mark in front of the initial php tag? i.e. <?php

 tagjumper42598:

Wouldn’t it just look better without it, so why add it?


Maybe, but I highly doubt anyone really cares…
Besides, in pure PHP files, you’ll only find one <?php tag at the very top of the file.
In the views, we now mostly use template engines that make using the php tags obsolete.
Instead of <?php echo $variable; ?>, we’ll write {{ $variable }} instead.

Why does PHP show <?php echo ""I love PHP!""; on Codecademy?
However, in PHP website it shows <?php echo ""I love PHP!""; ?> 
Can someone explain please?

In a PHP-only file, there’s no need to provide a closing tag.
<?php

$hello = 'Hello, World!';

echo $hello;


It’s actually a PSR-2 recommendation to omit it:

The closing ?> tag MUST be omitted from files containing only PHP.

That said, within a HTML file, you’ll have to use the closing tag, otherwise the rest of the file would be treated as if it was PHP code.
So, for example:
<html>
<body>
  <h1><?php echo 'Hello, World!'; ?></h1>
  <p>This is a simple Hello World page.</p>
</body>
</html>

Hope this answers your question!

Hi there,
As a beginner and following this course it took me a long time to figure out why in this exercise a switch wouldn’t work the same as an if/else statement. Apparently a switch does loose comparisons with “==” and gets different results than “===”, especially in this exercise. Maybe good to mention that in the part about switch statements. Now in the course it is introduced as if switch is a good substitute for “===” if/else statements.

They do mention the difference between them in the Identical and Not Identical Operators:

When looking through PHP code, you may encounter another operator—the equal operator (==). Like the identical operator, the equal operator will return TRUE if the left operand is the same as the right operand and FALSE if it’s not. But the equal operator is less strict than the identical operator and can have some hard to predict results, so we prefer to only use the identical operator.

If you use the equal operator, then some things might be interpreted by the computer differently to what you actually want.
For example, 5 == ""5"" can come up as TRUE, where 5 === ""5"" will come up as false.

Yes, thanks. But I meant specifically what type of comparison a switch statement does (==), that was not mentioned. For this exercise it makes all the difference.

Ah, okay, I see what you mean. Yea, a switch statement only does a loose comparison, which means it uses ==. If you want to use a strict comparison, then its better to use an if / elseif statement.
So for this exercise, an if / elseif would have been better.
I agree that they should mention this in that part of the lesson.

Can that be the reason that my function is not accepted?
function truthyOrFalsy($str){
   switch($str){
case '[]':
case NULL:
 case '':
 case '0':
 case 0:
return ""False"";
default: 
return ""True""
 }
}

Hey there, you’re overcomplicating things.
First we need to ask ourselves if a switch statement is really necessary for such a simple ask.
We only really need to check:
That if the value provided is truthy, we return true
Otherwise, we return false
How could we achieve this?

Ok, I know, I thought they want us too practice  what we learned. Still my solution also should be working, but the error says, that its giving the wrong return value. Any clue why?

Your function works fine for me, you just forgot to add a semicolon after “return “True””.
Cheers

I didn’t know where to put this, and it’s not a big deal, but there’s a typo in this lesson on the last line of the second paragraph; “and the 2nd” should be “at the 2nd”.

Bug in PHP - Request Superglobals
There seems to be an issue with the first instruction in HTML Form Handling in PHP - Request Superglobals. I am using print_r($var) to print the following superglobals:

$_REQUEST
$_GET
$_POST

I am passing in the above superglobals as arguments for print_r() in the designated spaces with the PHP tag, but it keeps asking if I used print_r() to print the $_REQUEST array. Maybe I am doing it wrong, but I can’t figure out any other possible solutions.

Hey there,
What does your code look like? Just to make sure 

So I had the same issue you did.  I messed around for a while with no success, then I thought it might be possible that the PHP statement needed to be made all on the one line, (like the example below). That worked.
<?php print_r($var) ?>

I’m posting this for anyone in the future who gets stuck on this.

Why don’t these run the same? The first is my answer to the exercise, the second is the official solution. I don’t see any reason why they wouldn’t work the same way. Can anybody help?
echo “Hello, there. What’s your first name?\n”;
$first_name = readline("">> “);
if (strlen(first_name) > 8) {
  echo ""Hi, {first_name}. That’s a long name.”;
}  elseif (strlen(first_name) > 3) {
  echo ""Hi, {first_name}."";
}  else {
“Hi, ${first_name}. That’s a short name.”;
}
__________ Official Solution __________________
echo “Hello, there. What’s your first name?\n”;
$name = readline("">> "");
$name_length = strlen($name);
if (name_length > 8) {
  echo ""Hi, {name}. That’s a long name."";
} elseif (name_length > 3) {
  echo ""Hi, {name}."";
} else {
echo “Hi, ${name}. That’s a short name.”;
}

They would produce the same result. Both are correct.
Except for the missing $ here and there.
Do you remember the error message that you received?
Edit : found it.
I copy/pasted your code.
On the first line : $first_name = readline("">> “);
The second double-quote is what’s causing the problem. Now I’m not sure how you got that. But that double-quote needs to look like the first one.
Edit 2 :
Nope. Not just on that first line actually.
Here as well : ""Hi, {first_name}. That’s a long name.”;
And here : “Hi, ${first_name}. That’s a short name.”;

How weird! Not sure how that happened at all. Thanks for your help!

So, I noticed I could still get the code to run with or without the {} around the variable name when it was in the middle of the string.
if (name_length > 8) {
  echo ""Hi, {name}. That’s a long name."";
} elseif (name_length > 3) {
  echo ""Hi, {name}."";
} else {
echo “Hi, ${name}. That’s a short name.”;
}
Here’s mine:
if ($name_length > 8) {
echo “Hi, $first_name. That’s a long name.”;
} elseif ($name_length > 3) {
echo “Hi, $first_name.”;
} else {
echo “Hi, $first_name. That’s a short name.”;
}
How do I know whether I need to use those curly brackets around a variable like $first_name?

What the difference if you use return in this exercise?

Where would you want to use return in this exercise?
Remember that echo just outputs to the console or browser where return returns a value at the end of a function.
So if you use return at the end of this exercise, you’ll notice that nothing prints to the browser, and so we need to use echo in order to print to the browser.
I do not fully understand the entirety of your question, and so I hope I have answered it, or at least guided you to the answer.

In the exercise to this section “Pass by reference”, the requirement “that it permanently changes the variable it’s invoked with” was not stated clearly in the instructions. I had to click the “hint” section below to find out what I did wrong. This made me spend more time on this number.
Please include this important detail on the original instructions otherwise it will be very confusing.

I’m stuck on step 4… no matter how much I test my working code, it just won’t complete!!! I’ve tested valid and invalid card numbers. Any idea?

This exercise appears to be bugged and I can’t move on, the code I have seems to be correct but the steps won’t complete.

Hi! I wrote this functions and work properly in the exercise.
if ($_SERVER[“REQUEST_METHOD”] == “POST”) {
card_type = _POST[“credit”];
card_num = _POST[“card-num”];
donation_amount = _POST[“amount”];
if(strlen($card_num)<100){
if($card_type===“mastercard”){
if(preg_match(""/5[1-5][0-9]{14}/"",$card_num)===1){
$feedback = $success_message;
}else     $feedback = $error_message;
}elseif($card_type===""visa""){      if(preg_match(""/4[0-9]{12}([0-9]{3})?([0-9]{3})?/"",$card_num)===1){
    $feedback = $success_message;
  }else     $feedback = $error_message;
  
}

}else{
$feedback = $error_message;
}
Regards!

I used your code, but it did not work for me.  There is no hint or whatsoever… so im a little stuck…
This is my code:
if ($_SERVER[“REQUEST_METHOD”] == “POST”) {
$card_type = $_POST[""credit""];

$card_num = $_POST[""card-num""];

$donation_amount = $_POST[""amount""];

if(strlen($card_num)<100){
if($card_type === “Mastercard”){
if(preg_match(""/5[1-5][0-9]{14}/"", $card_num) === 1){

  $feedback = $succes_message;

} else {

  $feedback = $error_message; 

}

} elseif($card_type === “Visa”){
if(preg_match(""/4[0-9]{12}([0-9]{3})?([0-9]{3})?/"", $card_num) 

=== 1) {

 $feedback = $succes_message; 

} else {
$feedback = $error_message;

}

}
} else {
$feedback = $error_message;
}
}

Few things to watch out for…
You’re checking for “Mastercard” and “Visa”
if($card_type === ""Mastercard"")
elseif($card_type === ""Visa"")

but, in the HTML, we’re getting the following values:
<option value=""mastercard"">Mastercard</option>
<option value=""visa"">Visa</option>


You also assign $feedback the value of $succes_message, but that is not the correct variable name. Re-read the instructions if in doubt.
You’re almost there! Just be careful as to what is asked of you, and you’ll be just fine.
Keep going

Hi there! I was trying to understand the filter_var and preg_match in-built functions…i found it little tricky so i decided to take help of the google ,but still  it is away from my reach. a helping hand would be good ? thanks!!!

I am stuck on step 3. Just can’t get past it. Tried many different ways. 
Here is one of my solutions:
if ($_SERVER[""REQUEST_METHOD""] === ""POST"") {
    $card_type = $_POST[""credit""];
    $card_num = $_POST[""card-num""];
    $donation_amount = $_POST[""amount""];
// Write your code here:
    $length = strlen($card_num);
    if ($length < 100) {
      if ($card_type === ""mastercard"") {
          testRegEx(""/5[1-5][0-9]{14}/"");
      } elseif ($card_type === ""visa"") {
          testRegEx(""/4[0-9]{12}([0-9]{3})?([0-9]{3})?/"");
      }
    } else {
      $feedback = $error_message;
    }  
}
function testRegEx ($regex) {
  if (preg_match($card_num, $regex) === 1) {
    $feedback = $succes_message;
  } else {
    $feedback = $error_message;
  }
}

For the above code I get this error:

PHP Fatal error:  Cannot redeclare testRegEx() (previously declared in /home/ccuser/workspace/php-form-val-8/src/index.php:29) in /home/ccuser/workspace/php-form-val-8/src/index.php on line 35

Here is another solution, more in line with the instructions:
if ($_SERVER[""REQUEST_METHOD""] === ""POST"") {
    $card_type = $_POST[""credit""];
    $card_num = $_POST[""card-num""];
    $donation_amount = $_POST[""amount""];
// Write your code here:
    $length = strlen($card_num);
    if ($length < 100) {
      if ($card_type === ""mastercard"") {
        if (preg_match($card_num, ""/5[1-5][0-9]{14}/"") === 1) {
          $feedback = $succes_message;
        } else {
          $feedback = $error_message;
        }
      } elseif ($card_type === ""visa"") {
        if (preg_match($card_num, ""/4[0-9]{12}([0-9]{3})?([0-9]{3})?/"") === 1) {
          $feedback = $succes_message;
        } else {
          $feedback = $error_message;
        }
      }
    } else {
      $feedback = $error_message;
    }  
}

For this code I get the error below:

It looks like your code has a syntax error. Check that you’re not missing any semi-colons etc.

Also tried a switch but I’ll leave that out here.
I really can’t see the problem. Anyone? Thanks!




 tvbz:

    $length = strlen($card_num);
    if ($length < 100) {
      if ($card_type === ""mastercard"") {
        if (preg_match($card_num, ""/5[1-5][0-9]{14}/"") === 1) {
          $feedback = $succes_message;
        } else {
          $feedback = $error_message;
        }
      } elseif ($card_type === ""visa"") {
        if (preg_match($card_num, ""/4[0-9]{12}([0-9]{3})?([0-9]{3})?/"") === 1) {
          $feedback = $succes_message;
        } else {
          $feedback = $error_message;
        }
      }
    } else {
      $feedback = $error_message;
    }  



This is closer to what we’re trying to accomplish here. Almost there.

$length = strlen($card_num);
if ($length < 100) {

Could be done in just one line.

if (preg_match($card_num, ""/5[1-5][0-9]{14}/"")

For the regular expression match, the pattern comes first, subject second.

$feedback = $succes_message;

Instructions state:

If so, assign $feedback the value of $success_message .


These should get you closer to completion. Keep going!
