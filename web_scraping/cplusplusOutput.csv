My solution for the Learn C++ FizzBuzz Question 
#include <iostream>

int main(){
  
  
  for(int i = 1; i <=100; i++){

    if(i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0){
      std::cout << ""FizzBuzz\n"";
    }
    else if(i % 3 == 0){
      std::cout << ""Fizz\n"";
    }
    else if(i % 5 == 0){
      std::cout << ""Buzz\n"";
    }
    else{
      std::cout << i << ""\n"";

  return 0 ;

great work! 
there is an official Learn C++ GitHub repo: https://github.com/Codecademy/learn-cpp
(if you want to upload to it)

This was my solution, a bit longer but it does the job.
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string finalAnswer = """";

int main() {

  // Brain explodes here:
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
    if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0){
      finalAnswer = ""FizzBuzz"";
      std::cout << finalAnswer << std::endl;
    }
    else if (i % 3 == 0){
      finalAnswer = ""Fizz"";
      std::cout << finalAnswer << std::endl;
    }
    else if (i % 5 == 0){
      finalAnswer = ""Buzz"";
      std::cout << finalAnswer << std::endl;
    }
    else {
      std::cout << i << std::endl;      
    }
  }
}


Hello!! I notice when I put this statement:
if(i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0){
std::cout << “FizzBuzz\n”;
}
at the end I don’t get the correct answer…why is this? Is this somehow tied to the fact that code is usually read from top to bottom?

3,A faster way to compile and execute c++ code?,"Get Help,Git","variables,general",3,"
Very simple question,
it is taking me a long time to run code once. Is there a faster way to compile than typing into “BASH” g++ hello.cpp -o hello ./hello?
This takes very long.

combine the commands into one line and use ctrl p or up to repeat previous commands
you should probably also add -Wall

Use control C to copy and control v to paste or else use a ide if the code works paste it in codecademy

4,Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz,"Get Help,Git",,8,"
I did the task as instructions and as per my knowledge. However, at the end, I would not get sorted into any house. Comparing my code to the sample on github, the difference I saw is that my version had a + 1 on each answer, i.e:
if (answer4 == 1) {
hufflepuff + 1;
}
However, in the github version, it is:
if (answer4 == 1) {
hufflepuff++;
}
Why does ++; work and + 1; doesn’t?
","
hufflepuff + 1 is an expression but isn’t a reassignment to the variable.
All of the following would work:
hufflepuff = hufflepuff + 1;
hufflepuff += 1;
hufflepuff++;

The third option has the limit of only adding 1. The first two could increment the variable by any value.
Hope this helps!

Hi,
Thanks for the reply. But wouldn’t the + 1 be counted as Arithmetic? Like, hufflepuff + 8; wouldnt work as well? what about hufflepuff + ravenclaw?

hufflepuff + 8 would evaluate to whatever the value of hufflepuff is + 8, but where would that value be assigned? hufflepuff += 8 is shorthand for hufflepuff = hufflepuff + 8 Without the assignment operator = hufflepuff would still point to whatever value it did before. hufflepuff++ is shorthand for hufflepuff = hufflepuff + 1.
For example:
int hufflepuff = 2;
cout << hufflepuff + 8;
cout << hufflepuff;
hufflepuff += 8;
cout << hufflepuff;
hufflepuff++;
cout << hufflepuff;

Output:

10 <<This is the value of the evaluated expression: hufflepuff + 8
2  <<hufflepuff is still 2
10 <<hufflepuff’s value was changed by hufflepuff += 8
11 <<hufflepuff’s value was changed again by hufflepuff++

The value of hufflepuff didn’t change until after a reassignment using = or ++.

I got it now, the = sign makes it stick, just like it was explained to me but I didnt think it would apply in this case.
Thanks for the info.

Explain what I should change to make the code work.

Check your error message, it’s pretty descriptive
sortinghat.cpp:49:3: error: expected ';' before if'
      if (answer2 == 1) {
      ^~

So it says in line 49: expected ';' before if', if you check a line before your if, you have std::cin >> answer3 without the ;
The rest of the else ifs in that clause don’t work because the first if isn’t considered valid.

Thanks, bro. Completely missed that.

5,Functions,"Get Help,Git",functions-c,7,"
In funtions in the following example
#include 
// Define oscar_wilde_quote() below:
void oscar_wilde_quote() {
std::cout << “The highest, as the lowest, form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\n”;
}
int main() {
// Call your function here:
oscar_wilde_quote();
}
What happens?What is the use of it?
Instead we can just write
#include 
// Define oscar_wilde_quote() below:
int main() {
std::cout << “The highest, as the lowest, form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\n”;
}
The above will also make the code smaller
Can someone explain what are functions 
Thank You
","
Hello! Functions are reusable code that can be used many times, by simply saying the function name. In this example, the function is quite long winded, but if you had a longer section of code, checking an input against certain arrays, and then print something out-and if this took 10 lines of code to do, you wouldn’t want to keep writing that out-so, you can write that out once (in a function), then just call the function as many times as you needed.
I hope this helps!

Hi @codeneutrino Thanks for replying
I have two questions
Q1)Even if I write the code as follows :
#include
// Define oscar_wilde_quote() below:
void oscar_wilde_quote() {
std::cout << “The highest, as the lowest, form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\n”;
}
int main() {
// Call your function here:
oscar_wilde_quote();
}
int main1() {
// Call your function here:
oscar_wilde_quote();
}
Here I have written two times but the statement does not get printed twice it is just the same output. You can try by yourself
Q2) ‘the function is quite long winded’ What is the meaning of this sentence
Thank You

Try calling both oscar_wilde_quote() functions within the same main() function.



 krish2882005:

‘the function is quite long winded’ What is the meaning of this sentence


I meant that the name of the function is quite long, compared to what it does.

Hi @codeneutrino
yes that works but why cant I call it in more than one main function

The main function has special properties, if you will, in C++. It shows the program that the code inside it will be executed. Here is some more reading on the subject.

Ok,Thanks a lot.Got It
"
6,I'm cofused by the pass-by-reference section,"Get Help,Git",references-pointers,3,"
void swap_num(int &i, int &j) {

  int temp = i;
  i = j;
  j = temp;

}

int main() {

  int a = 100;
  int b = 200;

  swap_num(a, b);

  std::cout << ""A is "" << a << ""\n"";
  std::cout << ""B is "" << b << ""\n"";

}

According to code academy, the code as such will swap the numbers in the results so that A is B and B is A. However, if you remove the & (making it a reference no longer) it will just print A is A and B is B.
I completed the exercise but I don’t feel that it very well explained how making something a reference changes it’s value or changes how the code is out-put.
","
Hello! When you pass something by reference, a change to the parameter will directly affect the value of the variable passed into the function. Say if we took a function:
void add_num(int &no1, int no2) {
no1 = no1 + no2;
no2 = 5;
}

When we run the code:
int main() {

  int a = 100;
  int b = 200;

  add_num(a, b);

  std::cout << ""A is "" << a << ""\n"";
  std::cout << ""B is "" << b << ""\n"";

}

Since we passed no1 by reference, the variable a is directly changed, so the value of a after running the function is now 300. Since no2 was not passed by reference, it does not get altered in the function.
Passed by reference and not essentially have something to do with memory: when you pass something by reference, they refer to the same place in memory, whereas when you don’t pass something by reference, a copy of that object is made, so the original isn’t altered.
Here is some more reading on it.
I hope this helps!

That does help, thanks, it’s a better explanation than the lesson, even though this is still kind of a weird one for me to wrap my head around…

7,Text adventure: Can't get this while loop to work,"Get Help,Git","loops,general",17,"
Hi,
I am trying to do the text adventure project (https://www.codecademy.com/practice/projects/build-a-text-adventure), and I’m having some problems. I’ll paste the code below. Note that I am using filler text here:

#include <iostream>

int main () {

  
  std::cout << ""\nLorem ipsum\n\n"";

  char choice1;

  std::cout << ""Make a choice: A, B or C?"";  
  std::cin >> choice1;
  
  while (choice1 != 'A', 'a', 'B', 'b', 'C', 'c') {
    
    std::cout << ""Invalid entry. Try again!"";    
    std::cin >> choice1;
    
  }
  
    
  if (choice1 == 'A' or choice1 == 'a') {
    
    std::cout << ""\nYou chose A.\n\n"";
    
  }
  
  else if (choice1 == 'B' or choice1 == 'b') {
    
    std::cout << ""\nYou chose B.\n\n"";
    
  }
  
  else if (choice1 == 'C' or choice1 == 'c') {
    
    std::cout << ""\nYou chose C.\n\n"";
    
  }


}


I am coding in notepad and compiling/executing in Windows, as Codecademy keeps disconnecting on me, at least in this exercise. In any case, when I execute the program I get to the “Make a choice” line, but when I try to make an input, I get the “Invalid entry” line no matter what I type, whether I type “A” or “b” or “x” or “1”. And if I type several characters, like “ax”, I get the “Invalid input” line an equal number of times, repeatedly. After a while, the program crashes.
What I want is that the player will get the “Invalid entry” line (one of them, not one for each character they type), no matter what they type unless it’s one of the six charcters I have entered, and that they will get this indefinitely until they enter a valid character. Then I want them to get the “You chose X” line, corresponding to what character they typed.
I have tried several alternatives, including:

 while (choice1 != 'A' and choice1 != 'a' and choice1 != 'B' and choice1 != 'b' and choice1 != 'C' and choice1 != 'c')


But I can’t get it to work, so I imagine I must be doing something fundamentally wrong.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

there’s only one comparison being made there
you could start with figuring out how to compare one character to several, without involving a loop or user input, and when you know how to do that you can move on to the next problem whatever that is
comparing one thing to several is repetition, I suggest using a loop
and, if you’re writing code to handle one character at a time, then you probably shouldn’t expect it to do something smart when you input several characters at once, that seems a bit like you haven’t entirely decided what should happen there

I am not sure I understand. First, I don’t understand what you mean with “comparing” in this context. Secondly, I am not sure how I would figure out how to figure that out. That’s kind of the problem.

I thought using while is using a loop?

and, if you’re writing code to handle one character at a time, then you probably shouldn’t expect it to do something smart when you input several characters at once, that seems a bit like you haven’t entirely decided what should happen there

My assumption was that as long as the player types anything except for the characters I have entered, he would get the “Invalid entry” line. Do I have to include code for all types of input? As in, explicitly prohibiting the player inputting integers, strings, etc.? Seems like it would be better to say “you can only enter this”, instead of “you can not enter this nor this nor this nor this nor this”.




 shampoomactavish:

I am not sure I understand. First, I don’t understand what you mean with “comparing” in this context.


You’re using a comparison operator !=, meaning “not equal to”. 

If you were told to write a function that accepts a char and a string, and returns whether the char can be found in that string, is that something you could do?
You would probably write a loop where you look at each char in the string, comparing it to the char to search for.
If you write such a function, you could then use that in your condition, and there would be no messing around with manually repeating code to compare the char to each of the other ones.
while (!isOneOf(choice1, ""aAbBcC"")) {
    ...
}





 shampoomactavish:

Do I have to include code for all types of input?





 shampoomactavish:

And if I type several characters, like “ax”, I get the “Invalid input” line an equal number of times, repeatedly.


That’s giving your program different input from what you seem to be trying to make it do.
If you program A and test B then yeah B probably won’t do what you want, maybe you should test A instead, or also implement B.




 shampoomactavish:

choice1 != 'A', 'a', 'B'


There’s nothing there saying that choice1 should be compared to 'a', for that to happen you would need to use some comparison operator and pass it the two values you want to compare.
Code is instructions, so if you want something to happen, you’ve got to write instructions that makes it so.


If you were told to write a function that accepts a char and a string, and returns whether the char can be found in that string, is that something you could do?
You would probably write a loop where you look at each char in the string, comparing it to the char to search for.
If you write such a function, you could then use that in your condition, and there would be no messing around with manually repeating code to compare the char to each of the other ones.

I see. I think I could write something that checked whether there is an “a” if the user typed something like “large”, for instance, but I don’t know how I would account for the user typing something like “Aab” or “ball”, in which case they would be typing several letters that count as valid choices. How can I restrict the player from typing several things in the ‘stdcin >> choice1;’ ? Ideally, they should only be able to type one character. I don’t believe the course has covered that, however.
Thank you for your help thus far.

You can’t physically prevent a user from giving that input, that’s probably not what you mean should happen. Instead you would need to decide how your program should react to that happening.

Presumably you’d want to do this:
https://asciinema.org/a/zu6gH3SE0sYUDvbTeJw9aIj22
But you can’t really talk about how to write that as code yet, because you haven’t yet decided what should happen.
When you firmly decide what should happen, you are giving yourself a reference, something that you can compare to what you currently have, which in turn tells you what needs to change. You give yourself the ability to identify problems, and it is only when you’ve done that that you can begin to solve them.


You can’t physically prevent a user from giving that input, that’s probably not what you mean should happen. Instead you would need to decide how your program should react to that happening.

Obviously I can’t prevent the user from pressing several keys on their keyboard, but surely it’s possible to limit the amount of characters they can enter in a field? For instance, if I try paying a bill on my online banking service and I have to enter my social security number, I can’t enter more than 11 numbers. If I try, nothing will show up.
This is a bit beside the point, however, since this is not something that is being learnt in this course (at least not thus far).

It’s not the input that changes. It’s what you do with the input that changes.
So what should your program do?
You can’t say that the input isn’t there. It is. How should your program react to it?
Why would you “not be able” to enter further input? What would the program need to be doing when it receives that input?
What is your program doing when you seemingly can enter input?
What happens when you press a key? What happens currently, and what do you want to happen instead?
There’s no prevention. There are things happening. What are those?

There are some parts to this that you do not know and are not able to figure out entirely on your own. But by observing what you can see and combining that with what you do know, you can say a LOT about what needs to be different.



 shampoomactavish:

surely it’s possible to limit the amount of characters they can enter in a field?


Who controls that field? Do they still receive keystrokes? What do they do when they receive those keystrokes? What do they do when it seems like something can be entered, what do they do when it seems like something can’t be entered, what’s the controller of that field doing differently?

So, let’s say you run your program.
You press K on your keyboard.
k shows up. SOMETHING printed k. What?
Is your program able to see that k?
If not, then who printed k?
When can your program see k?

I’m not entirely sure I’m following you. However, I did make some changes to my code, following the logic I had used from the beginning. I then got it to work as I wanted, although only in the terminal on Codecademy; when I compile and execute on my own computer, the program crashes after I make a “right” choice. So I’m not sure what that’s all about, but the code now demonstrably works the way I want it to. I’m sure there is a more elegant way of doing it, and I will try to look closer at what you’ve written to try and figure it out, but I thought I should share that I got it to work decently for now.

#include <iostream>

int main () {

  
  std::cout << ""\nLorem ipsum\n\n"";

  std::string choice1;

  std::cout << ""Make a choice: A, B or C?"";  
  std::cin >> choice1;
  
  while (choice1 != ""A"" and choice1 != ""a"" and choice1 != ""B"" and choice1 != ""b"" and choice1 != ""C"" and choice1 != ""c"") {
    
    std::cout << ""Invalid entry. Try again!"";    
    std::cin >> choice1;
    
  }
  
    
  if (choice1 == ""A"" or choice1 == ""a"") {
    
    std::cout << ""\nYou chose A.\n\n"";
    
  }
  
  else if (choice1 == ""B"" or choice1 == ""b"") {
    
    std::cout << ""\nYou chose B.\n\n"";
    
  }
  
  else if (choice1 == ""C"" or choice1 == ""c"") {
    
    std::cout << ""\nYou chose C.\n\n"";
    
  }


}



By what measurement does it crash? What does that look like? What input did you use? If your run it in a debugger (for example gdb, and make sure to compile with debug info (-g) and without optimisations (no -O2)), the debugger should be able to tell you what line the crash happened at.
But maybe when you say crash you really mean that the program exited. This would again be a comparison of expectations and observations - did you expect it to do something else, and how exactly is that different.
Your terminal doesn’t send input to your program until you press enter. You’d notice this because, even if you only read one character, it still never reaches the program until enter is pressed. You also have the ability to use backspace, arrow keys and a bunch of other things, none of which your own code is providing. After the realization that your terminal does this, you can then consider, can the terminal be asked to behave differently? It can.

By crash, I mean that the program exits and then restarts shortly after. What I expect to happen is for the program to print “You chose A.”, for instance (given that I entered “A” or “a” in the program), but instead the program exits and restarts. Again, this issue does not arise when I use the terminal to compile and execute here on Codeacademy; then I get the printed text as expected.
I had not heard of gdb, I will definitely check that out.

Maybe it printed “You chose A” and then exited, would you be able to tell the difference?
Because it sounds to me like you’re saying that a window closes. It would do that when the program finishes, wouldn’t it?
Pretty sure it isn’t restarting itself. You didn’t write code that says to do that, did you?

It seems my overeager antivirus software was to blame for the restarting issue. After I turned it off, the program stopped restarting itself. Then after I did that and added some more code, it went on to that code, so it seems the problem was indeed that it printed “You chose A” and then exited, as you suggested. Thus it seems that I am currently able to continue writing my program the way I had planned. For now, at least.
Thanks a lot for your help.

How do we refer to chars in c++?
– Single quotes. Not double quotes.
Your code should run after this.
Welcome to the forums  

Yes running the code with single quotes instead of double quotes can solve the error

This will run perfectly. Some languages are very open to brute formatting, others not so. At least it makes for cleaner more readable code, and will help when you need to transition to other languages. For future reference you can format your text here too by clicking </> before pasting the code. It helps to troubleshoot errors better.

His main code works perfectly, but to know the real problem, you must study the error well. The error says that there is a problem with the ostream, which is the c++ standard library. Because you did not include the library properly, all your code becomes void. However, there is an easy fix. Just add the ostream library to your file like this:
#include <iostream>

Put this on the beginning of your code and it will work perfectly. I also recommend specifying the name space of your code so you don’t have to be typing  std:: all the time.
Here is your code but in a perfected format:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << ""Hello\n"";
  cout << ""Goodbye\n"";
  
  return 0;
}

Hope this helped!

Sure, but this was what I was referring to.

So I am building a c++ text adventure.
I have just started writing my code.
I want this story to have multiple endings
So if you read the last 5-6 lines of the code that are the 2 options that I gave
So if I create a if else statement such as if b==1 then say that the plane crashed.
This message( The plane crashed) will be shown to the user but  the story will continue to move forward. But practically if the plane crashed the program should end.
In easy terms: If user selects the wrong option I want the code to end at that particular place and not go further
So what should I do in that code?
","
I want the code to stop after a particular if else statement

Return 0 from the main. This will say that the program wants to formally close.

To built on what @toastedpitabread said:
In the event you needed to close a program from a function that is not in main, you can use the exit command included in <stdlib.h>
It takes an integer as an arguement, with 0 meaning that the program terminated correctly with no errors:
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>

int stop() {
  exit(0);
}

int main() {
  std::cin >> n;
  if (n == 0) {
    stop();
  } else {
    std::cout << ""You did not click 0"";
  }

13,Can someone explain what is happening in the bleep C++ for loop,"Get Help,Git","references-pointers,general",7,"
I was working through Bleep in the C++ course in the section on references-pointers found here:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-plus-plus/projects/cpp-bleep
There are a couple instances in the solution, inside nested loops, that have somethings like this:

if ( text [ i + j ] == word [ j ] )

In this instance ’ i ’ is from the first for loop and the ’ j ’ is the second nested for loop. I’m confused about which values are being passed and what we’re comparing. I assume we’re trying to compare letter values to one another? But in that case why are we adding ’ i + j '? Why wouldn’t it just be text[ i ] == word [ j ]? I’ve written it out on paper and am still confused about how it works. At least numerically it would seem that no matter if the letters match or not, during the first loop of ’ j ’ that i = 0  so no matter what ’ i + j ’ will always == [ j ]. But if instead we’re looking at what letter values in the portions held at text[i] and word[i] what is happening with text[i + j]?  Hopefully this confusion makes sense and someone can explain what is happening. Thank you!

that’s straight up wrong and is reading outside the string

It’s listed as the solution for the problem though. When I remove the ‘+ j’ it breaks the code so it doesn’t function properly. When I add it back it works again.

not sure what your point is
if you mean that it should be that way because some form of authority put it there, then, i explained what the problem is, and that is observable and easily reasoned about. consider the max value of i+j and consider the maximum valid index, i+j is larger than that, so that’s outside. and it is observable by printing out the size and the index used
as for what SHOULD be done, well, what would you do with pen and paper? having code and not knowing what it does is a bit backwards, normally what you do is to decide what should happen and then describe that in code, and because this (the task of censoring a word) is something you can trivially do with pen and paper, you already have an observable reference for what should happen there.
so you would consider where the values i and j come from, and what the program is supposed to look at, and then you can consider how those two relate to one another and then formulate a correct version. or, use any strategy that you’d come up with, how you’d do it manually is often the first thing to consider, by just being human you already have the answer, it’s something we’d do without conscious thought

Thank you for your reply ionatan. Yes, i trusted (the “authority”) whoever added the “solution” to be correct. When you’re learning new concepts what is observable and easily reasoned about isn’t always so clear. I don’t believe it’s backwards, no. I’m trying to better understand how this solution works so that when faced with something similar I’ll have a better idea of how to approach applying the concept to another problem. That’s why I wrote the question. When trying to solve problems in your code don’t you search for solutions and check them against your ideas as your learning new concepts? I did write it out manually but I struggle applying pseudo code in syntactics as I haven’t spent that long in the programming word.
Since you seem to now be taking the authoritative role here I’ll ask you some more questions in regard to you reply. Why is it wrong to move outside the the scope of the string if the you the code still returns the result you want? What are possible problems that could arise? Why is it not throwing errors? Is there a way to better (or what would be your way) to write the for loop so that it doesn’t go outside of the scope of the string but stills cycles through comparing the text[ i ] to word[ j ]?

If a string is ten characters long and you read at position 15, do you expect to find something reasonable there?
It doesn’t give off errors because cpp does as you say. You said to read there, it reads there. The os might complain if you read somewhere outside the program itself.
To fix it you’d say the right thing instead of the wrong thing. That’s not very much about writing the loop differently, it’s about considering what should at all happen.
Stick to the strategies you come up with yourself. Relentlessly. If you’re not, then what are you following? No don’t even bother trying to find other strategies. Work on describing what you came up with instead.
You might want to use a different language for learning. C++ is fine to learn with if you can be really disciplined about it, making sure to stay in control and willing to observe everything and so on. I’d suggest C# or Go, anything with a compiler that is quick to complain and doesn’t let you get away with things, there are many such languages. Rust comes to mind too, that might actually give you a hard time though as a result of being really picky about what it allows to be compiled in ways that are non-obvious to the beginner. C++ is fine too, but you’ll run into a lot of cases where it doesn’t help you out in the slightest and simply does as you say.

I hate to necro a post, but I googled this for help as well and found myself here. So here is my theory for anyone who googled this problem and found themselves VERY unsatisfied with the moderator’s non-answer:
if (text[i+j] == word[j])
I was also quite confused by this line. however, the square brackets make it not a numerical value. Rather it is looking for the character in that number place as you theorized; however, if you just did i compared to j it would check i up to 8 characters, see there are no matches, and end the loop. The purpose of adding i + j makes so that when the second loop reiterates and checks 8 characters again, it checks it one space forward in the text string, checking 8 character bunches, and only returning an asterisk chain if every single letter matches when it iterates through the 8 character bunches at different spots in the character string.
The reason you can’t just use if (text[i] == word[j]) is because by this logic, it will check the 1 letter represented by i against all 8 letters of broccoli, (and if it matches) add one to match, but this makes it so that match is not equal to the character length of broccoli, so it never sees the if statement that calls the asterisk() function as true. In the original setting of the solution, the only purpose of i is to set the checking sequence in a new place instead of checking the beginning 8 characters over and over.
It seems like there would be much easier ways to do this, but I certainly would not say it is “straight up wrong”.
you could rewrite this program so that if(text[i] == word[j]) works, but in the solution’s current structure, it needs the +j to operate.
I hope this makes sense. I reread over this code 70 times trying to figure out what that line meant, because it clearly works, but the logic is hard to follow.

Firstly, you have not used break; after each of your switch cases, and so the switch just won’t work which is probably your issue. I am curious though, why use a switch instead of an if else in this situation? switches are good for large variety of options as it can simplify the code a little, but for a single either-or option, if else generally looks a bit better.

break has an effect, that effect is not needed here
your compiler can tell you if you’re missing a case for your enum if you use a switch, you don’t get that with if-statements. the cosmetic difference is insignificant anyway
this gives a warning:
enum Vehicle { Car, Bike, Tricycle };

int wheels (Vehicle v) {
    switch (v) {
        case Car: return 4;
    }
}

but this does not, because everything is covered
enum Vehicle { Car, Bike, Tricycle };

int wheels (Vehicle v) {
    switch (v) {
        case Car: return 4;
        case Bike: return 2;
        case Tricycle: return 3;
    }
}

and this does not, even though things are missing
enum Vehicle { Car, Bike, Tricycle };

int wheels (Vehicle v) {
    if (v == Car) {
        return 4;
    }
    return 2;

If i understood your question, it appears to me, at least that your vector code seems fine and it should compile with no issues. However, the error code that the compiler throws suggest that you’re attempting to create a function inside the main function, which is considered an illegal move.

","
Tradition. Or, if you prefer, convention as you almost imply. Notice that “integer” begins with the letter i and that’s the type used for counting in loops. Of course, j follows.

That makes sense!
I’m having a hard time following at times, and I think that part of it is because little instances like this aren’t explained all of time. It’s often recommended to google for help and examples. But when I do, things often look similar but different. I suppose that it’s a good thing to do the google searches so that we are then exposed to different ways of doing things and syntaxes. One of those differences is where you declare that you’re using the standard naming convention, so you don’t have to type std:: before you use something in the standard library. (Sorry if that isn’t exactly how it should be described. I’m still very new at all of this.) Also, things like NULL being purple in the example, but it types out red in the built-in IDE.
It’s little stuff like that that makes me second guess solutions at times, and I feel like that has a potential to throw many people off track. That being said, though, I appreciate the opportunity to dig a little deeper than CC and find even more information out. It’s a seriously deep rabbit hole. I’ve already spent hours of research outside of CC and saved MANY links to go back to.




 harrjt:

Notice that “integer” begins with the letter i and that’s the type used for counting in loops. Of course, j follows.


Equally, as we may often find ourselves using a for loop to iterate over an object which supports indexing, the i could be for index… 

Today, I saw the reference to iterator in the C# lesson on for loops. Hmmm…it’s one of those things we could make up our own urban legend about.  Kinda like, “How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop? … The world may never know.” (Unless you ask Mr. Owl.)

If you have a loop that should do more iterations then you’d continue making observations on the things that control that loop, presumably there’s some condition that is tested before each iteration so you could look at the values involved in that condition and compare to what they should be and whatever is different, you’d continue observing that thing, and so on, until you’re at the source of the problem

24,Bleep.cpp freeform project help,"Get Help,Git",references-pointers,2,"
In the references and pointers section in the c++ course, we’re instructed to create a program bleep.cpp. Here is the link to the lesson, and here is the solution.
When trying to plan a way to handle this, I came up with first iterating through the text given with a for loop. The problem I’m having is that if you try to iterate through the given text, which is a std::string, you’ll get letters returned to you. This makes it difficult to compare with the banned word we’re given.
The only thing I can think of is to iterate through the std::string, and if characters “b”, “r”, “o”, “c”, “c”, “o”, “l”, “i” are produced in sequence, then replace them with “*”. But I don’t know the best way to accomplish that, and even if I did, I’m confident there’s a better way to go about this.
If the text were a vector, I’d iterate through that and then that’d return words, which I could then compare with the banned word “broccoli” and push_back() an asterisk or the word depending on whether or not they were equal, however it’s not a vector; it’s a string. Is there a way I can create a vector comprised of words from a string? If so, I’d then be able to iterate through it no problem.
I know formulating a plan is the first step before actually writing the code, so if anyone can look through what I’ve written here and address my questions and overall approach that’d be great. If you have a suggestion as to how you’d do this, I’d greatly appreciate your insight too. I wasn’t really able to deduce the plan from the provided solution.
","
My solution is different from that you linked to, though the principles are the same.
For the bleep_it function, you can create a string of asterisks that matches the size of the word you want to bleep.  That means getting the size of whatever word is sent, then creating your bleep word to match.  Notice the solution you linked to did that.
Also notice that step 3 guides you to pass by reference so you can dynamically change the bleep word.
Then use text.find() and text.replace() to put your bleep into the bad word.

I have the program set to handle uppercase letters, but can’t seem to get the last two points.

For the punctuation hint, my solution was very crude, I think, but it does the work:
if (input[i] == ',' || input[i] == '?' || input[i] == '!') {
         result.push_back(input[i]);
   }

I saw a solution from another user that was much more elegant: they defined punctuation makers as another vector and followed the same steps in comparing the original string to the vowel vector.
Now the last part about the “!” was more complicated. The simplest solution I was able to come up after some research with was:
if (input[i] == '!') {
  result.push_back(result.back());
}

.back() returns the last element in the vector, so that way you’re including the last element again. It’s important though that this part comes before the punctuation rule that I mentioned first so that it won’t duplicate punctuation marks as well.
Both go inisde the outer loop. That way, you can guarantee you’ll only double vowels and not consonants!
My full code:
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {

  // Whale, whale, whale.
  // What have we got here?

  std::string input = ""hI, human!"";

  std::vector<char> vowels = {'a', 'A', 'e', 'E','i','I','o','O','u','U'};
  std::vector<char> result;

  for (int i = 0; i < input.size(); i++) {

    for (int j = 0; j < vowels.size(); j++) {

      if (input[i] == vowels[j]) {
        result.push_back(input[i]);
       }
       } 

    
 if (input[i] == 'e' || input[i] == 'u') {
       result.push_back(input[i]); 
      }

if (input[i] == '!') {
  result.push_back(result.back());
}

 if (input[i] == ',' || input[i] == '?' || input[i] == '!') {
         result.push_back(input[i]);

Hi, I’m currently working on the FizzBuzz project in the C++ course. I think I’ve implemented the code correctly, (or am on the correct path to doing so), but I’m running into an issue where it outputs as followed:
1
2
3
Fizz
4

…and so on.
If I implemented the code correctly then 3 should be replaced with Fizz and the other numbers should also be replaced accordingly. Is there an issue with the way I coded this? Here’s my code from the project:
#include <iostream>

int main() {

  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {

  std::cout << i << ""\n"";

    if (i % 3 == 0) {

      std::cout << ""Fizz\n"";

    }

    else if (i % 5 == 0) {

      std::cout << ""Buzz\n"";

    }

    else if (i % 15 == 0) {

      std::cout << ""FizzBuzz"";

    }

    else {

      std::cout << i << ""\n"";

    }

 }

}

Thank you

@typa98,
Welcome to the forums!
Check out what your code does immediately before your if-else statements.
Happy coding!

Now that you’ve pointed it out, I can see why the code was failing. Thank you for your help.

On a different note, does i = 15 output “FizzBuzz”? Because it seems like the first if would also be true?




 typa98:

    else if (i % 15 == 0) {

      std::cout << ""FizzBuzz"";

    }



Instead of checking for 15, check for 3 AND 5 in the same expression.  Otherwise you will get a false positive on large enumerations.
This was what I originally did on this site, but it fails on other sites with more strict condtionsl

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  for (int i = 1; i <= INT8_MAX; ++i)
    if (i % 3 == 0)
      cout << ""Fizz"" << endl;
    else if (i % 5 == 0)
      cout << ""Buzz"" << endl;
    else
      cout << i << endl;
  return 0;
}



It actually does not output FizzBuzz at 15 for me. There’s likely something I’m still missing but I’ll figure it out once I have some time later today

My code:

// Import libraries. //
#include <stdio.h>

// End of program. //

","
@paulgureghian,
The reason your program isn’t running as you expect it to is because you are using scanf() where you should be using a combination of printf() and scanf().  On a very basic level, just making that change would allow your program to “work”:
// Start of program. //

// Import libraries. //
#include <stdio.h>

// Define the main(). //
int main()
{
    int i, j, sum;
    printf(""Enter 1st integer: "");
    scanf(""%d"", &i);
    printf(""Enter 2nd integer: "");
    scanf(""%d"", &j);


    sum = i + j;

    printf(""Sum is: %d\n"", sum);
    return 0;
}

// End of program. //

That being said, you probably don’t need to be using scanf() to get an integer input in C++.  Is there any reason you would be opposed to using cout and cin?  A nearly identical program can be written using cout and cin:
#include<iostream>

int main()
{
  int i, j, sum;
  std::cout << ""Enter 1st integer: "";
  std::cin >> i;
  std::cout << ""Enter 2nd integer: "";
  std::cin >> j;

  sum = i + j;

  std::cout << ""Sum is: "" << sum << ""\n"";
  return 0;
}

You will still need to guard against inputs that are not integers, but you will have fewer problems overall.
If you really want and/or need to use scanf(), I would highly recommend reading through this post first, as it breaks down several ways that scanf() may have unexpected results.

It is a ‘C’ program, if that makes any difference. anyways, I used a combo of ‘printf’ and ‘scanf’ and it works. thanks.

Why are we doing this? I can’t understand, why first random number module 3 and then add 1?
rand() % 3 + 1

The computer will draw a random number. % will divide that number with the int of 3 as indicated. The result will be 0.xxx, 1.xxx or 2.xxx so, if you at 1 then the sum will be 1.xxx, 2.xxx or 3.xxx. Now since this value was indicated as a int, the computer will drop the .xxx under the 1, 2 or 3.

I was putting each planet in as a variable. In the hint they only put “weight” and “x” as variables. I know I was over-complicating it, but why would I not put each planet as variables? There’s a disconnect there that I’m not getting. Also, I don’t fully understand when to use what ‘type’; I guess. I understand that ‘int’ is whole numbers and ‘double’ is decimals, and so on. With that same lesson, I don’t understand why “weight” would be a double, and “x” would be int and not char? Is it because the user is going to put a number for “x”?

Hi, @cinemadrue, welcome to the Codecademy Forums!
There are a few ways to do this exercise.  Ideally, you would accomplish the task using either an if-else statement or a switch statement.  If you were doing one of those prior to looking at the hint, chances are your program would have accomplished the same thing, just a different way.
As for the variable types, the reason the hint uses double weight and int x is partially due to the instructions, and partially due to the math necessary for this program.
The prompt specifically tells you to ask the boxer the number of the planet he wants to fight on:

This is why the variable x is an int.  Of course, you could store this variable under a different name, such as planet, or you could even ask for the name of the planet.  In that case you wouldn’t store the variable as an integer, but you could still achieve the same outcome.
The reason weight is a double is because in the hint they reassign the value of weight after multiplying the initial weight by the other planet’s relative gravity and it needs to be a double to store this new value.  If you wanted, you could always store the original weight in an integer variable (maybe earth_weight) and the later value in a double variable (such as planet_weight).
Hope this clears up some of the confusion.  Happy coding!

Yes that does help. Thank you again for your help.

The function firt_three_multiples takes a number, it then creates a vector of three elements, the number it was given, that number multiplied by two, and that number multiplied by three. Those three numbers now exist in a container(in our case a vector). The function hands that container to whatever called it.
In main you call the function inside the for loop.
THe for loop basically says, call the function first_three_multiples on the number 8, to give me a container of the and print out each element in that container.

I can not understand
int max = 0
Does “max” mean the max among all the numbers?
or
is just a character which equals to 0
And
gryffindor > max
why can “gryffindor”  be larger than “max” which is already the largest number?
And
Does “a++” mean a + 1 or a + 1, a + 1 + 1, …
Please help me
","
max is a variable of type int, you can use it to hold on to integers. What it means is up to the programmer.
You can’t know which is largest until you’ve compared them all. Perhaps you might use max to store the largest value you’ve seen so far while you’re still carrying out the comparisons.
a++ increases a by 1 and returns the original value. ++a does the same thing, but returns the new value instead

Hello, I would like to ask a question which was asked in the OP.
we are intializing max at 0, and we are comparing the house int variables to max. What I don’t understand is, why are we comparing each house variable to zero? My (possibly faulty) logic states that we should be comparing house variables to each other, not to max.
Thank you in advance for help.
EDIT: I get it - there are four if statements, each statement checks with the one before to see if it is greater.

I haven’t done the project myself. I learned C++ several years ago from another source. From the context of you post, and the code snippet from the OP, I believe the integer variable max is originally assigned a value of 0. Then, as max is compared to each house, if the value of the house is greater than the current value of max, the value of max is replaced by the house value. After checking max against all houses, the value of max will be the highest house value. If you post more code, I may be able to give a better answer, but I believe that this is what is happening.
EDIT: I just noticed your edit. Seems like you got it. 

Yep!! Thanks for the reply anyway!

Hello,
You’ve cleared up a lot, but something is still nagging at my mind: If “max” is declared and initialized to equal 0, obviously every house we compare it to will be more. So wouldn’t the string of “if” statements just stop at the first one?

Welcome back to the forum.



 heyimaria1811:

I have no idea how to implement the arrays.


An array in C++ looks like this:
int some_numbers[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

The document also has an “Additional Instructions” section, which lists several functions that your code ought to include. Some of these, like the intro menu, don’t require arrays.
Have you made an attempt at all? If so, by all means post your code and we’ll help. If you’re expecting us to do it for you, well… no such luck, I’m afraid.

I think something wrong with compiler…please resolve this error
Both functions are correct…

Hello, @pranavjoshi514349753, and welcome to the forums.
I was able to replicate the SCT error shown in your post. The SCT for this challenge is expecting a space between <int> and first_three_multiples.

I am also using visual studio 2017 IDE for checking whether my code produce any compile time error but it can’t show any.(i.e space/white space between <int> and first_three_multiples .)
I don’t know but in any compiler this should not be a problem.

It’s not an actual error per se’. The Submission Correctness Test for the exercise is looking for a function named first_three_multiples. Without the space preceding the name, it cannot find it. Whoever wrote the SCT for the lesson didn’t account for learners leaving the space out. Feel free to submit a bug report if you like, and perhaps the course designer will consider your suggestion.

45,"When to use ""std::""","Get Help,Git",functions-c,6,"
I’m currently in the 6th section of the C++ course (Functions) and I’m running into more occasions where I don’t understand when to use the “std::” portion in the code.  I understand using it for ::cout and ::cin, but when/why do you include with with things like vector or string?
For example, I didn’t get this exercise right because I didn’t include std:: in front of string in…void name_x_times(std::string name, int x) {
Example of the full exercise below…
#include <iostream>

// Define name_x_times() below:
void name_x_times(std::string name, int x) {
  
  while (x > 0) {
    
    std::cout << name;
    x--;
    
  }

int main() {
  
  std::string my_name = ""Add your name here!"";
  int some_number = 5; // Change this if you like!
  // Call name_x_times() below with my_name and some_number
  name_x_times(my_name, some_number);

Recently I also had the same question and studied some about this. To understand this, we first need to know about namespaces. Here are links to articles that might be helpful:


Namespaces (Google C++ Style Guide)
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespaces


2.9 — Naming collisions and an introduction to namespaces (LearnCpp.com)
https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/2-9-naming-collisions-and-an-introduction-to-namespaces/
(In particular, it will be useful to read “The std namespace” section in this article.)


The string and vector which we want to use are in the C++ standard library, so they belong to the std namespace. This is why you need to add std:: to them. It is the same reason to use std:: for cout and cin.

Something else that helps out a lot is by typing:
using namespace std;
at the top of your entire program. That eliminates the use for std:: in anything. So you can just use cout instead of std::cout

Interesting.  Is that still considered “best practice”, or is this not something you typically can do?

I see it very often and I’d think that it’d save several keystrokes.

Importing the entire std namespace is generally considered a bad practice. You can Google it, and find many articles explaining why. You, the programmer, can decide for yourself whether you want to do it or not. One alternative is to only import the types or classes that you are going to use:
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::string;

string sayHi(string name) {
  return ""Hello "" + name + ""!"";
}
int main() {
  cout << ""Hello World!\n"";
  cout << sayHi(""Thomas"");
}

Hi there, welcome to the forums! 
As a quick note; C++ (“C plus plus”) and C# (“C sharp”) are two totally separate languages. The exercise you’re working on is part of the C++ course, though Codecademy do also have a C# course if you’d like to take it.
The second step of that exercise says this:

So, in the terminal (the right-hand pane of the Codecademy learning environment), you should type this:

Your program, at this stage, doesn’t ask for any input nor provide any output…
If you’re getting an error message when running g++ variable.cpp then we would need to see both your code and the error to be able to help you - which means posting them both here in the forums. (The links take you to the learning environment, which is unique to each user - so if I click that link, I see my already completed exercise and not your attempt.)
The Codecademy forum provides a quick and easy way to post properly-formatted code. All you need to do is look for the </> icon in the menu bar which appears at the top of the text box while you type.

Press Enter to go to a blank line, click that icon, and you will see this:

Just copy and paste your code directly from the editor into that highlighted portion, and we’ll be able to help you with any errors. You should post those as well, so we know what we’re up against.

47,Leap year exercise,"Get Help,Git",,11,"
// y = year
else if (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0 || y % 400 == 0) {
std::cout << y;
std::cout << "", Lucky you, this is a leap year\n"";

so as a whole this challenge wasn’t too crazy for me and I get the rest of the code.
the part I’m not understanding is why this, else if, is stated this way
the way I read it is if y is divided into 4 with no remainder AND y is divided into 100 with a remainder not equal to 0 or y is divided into 400 evenly with no remainder, this is a leap year.
the problem if the != portion. It means not equal to, right?
I feel it""s one of those things that I understand but my brain can""t fully grasp the concept of how it""s working code wise
","
Yes, you are correct. != means not equal.

Thanks! so im assuming, its saying either 4 is divided evenly and 100 is not or 4 is divided evenly and 400 is as well. when either of those pairs is both true, that makes it a leap year. Is that a good way to word it?

Actually, the way that would work is if 4 goes evenly into the year AND 100 does NOT go evenly into the year it’s a leap year OR if 400 goes evenly into the year it’s a leap year.

Man, makes perfect sense now. Thank you so much for taking the time to help over something so trivial… massive help.

You’re welcome! Happy to help.

I still don’t understand this. If 100 does not evenly go into the year, wouldn’t it not be a leap year?

If 4 does AND 100 does not, it’s a leap year. If 400 does, it’s a leap year.
Quote:

The Gregorian Calendar has become the internationally accepted civil calendar. The leap year rule for the Gregorian Calendar differs slightly from one for the Julian Calendar. The Gregorian leap year rule is: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is. The Gregorian dates for Easter are computed from a set of ecclesiastical rules and tables.

From here: https://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php

So does it go like this in terms of order?
if divisible by 4 = true and divisible by 100 does not equal 0 then statement is true and program moves on to display this is a leap year?
if divisible by 100 does = 0 than statement is false and will bring the OR into concern?

It does go from left to right. If the year is exactly divisible by 4, the next expression is evaluated, so we check if the year is not exactly divisible by 100. If that is true, then both expressions on either side of the && are true, so the if() condition is satisfied at that point, and the code inside the if block executes. If either of those expressions evaluates to false then the condition to the right of the || operator is checked. If the year is exactly divisible by 400 the if() condition is satisfied, and the code executes. The condition following || (or) is only evaluated if either of the conditions preceding it is false.

Ok thanks, very helpful!

Hello,
See the example with blue ?

I wanted, for revision, to guess what type of error it was (compile-time error, run-time error…) and I really can’t distinguish them. I could tell you the difference between types if you asked me to but I won’t recognize one if not from the ezample list given. To me they all seem logical ; it could be compile-time because the syntax is incorrect (the return has to be at the end), run-time error (cause you’re asking the computer to do something after the return which is impossible) and a logic error because this function is illogically written.
Thanks.
","
why would there be an error?
that’s a valid function.

it didn’t work though. The return isn’t at the end

there’s no such requirement

they said in the lesson the return had to be at the end and even showed that as an error example

If you intend for the code following return to be executed, then it would be considered a logical error. It will both compile and run as is.

Honestly you’d be better off just having one std::string name variable.
Not everyone has a first, middle, last name format. Certainly not everyone has less than 8 characters in their name, additionally you wouldn’t call someone by their full name always.
std::string name {};
std::cout << ""What would you like to be called?\n"";
std::getline(std::cin, name);
std::cout << ""Hello "" << name << ""\n"";

 trinitycribbs:

if anyone is up for clarifying the purpose of romanType::romanType(); and romanType::romanType(string);


before you look at purpose, what at all are they?
are they loops?
are they… numbers? modules…
what information do they process, what instructions do they carry out, when do they get used? that might say a lot about what their purpose is
your error messages are quite plain. read them. and don’t confuse the warnings for errors, they’re not. it says they’re not. but you should fix them too. something about multiple definitions. should that something be defined multiple times? you could look at where they’re mentioned in the code, maybe you’re repeating something. maybe you’re telling your compiler to compile the same thing several times, that would mean that there are duplicates

I pasted your files here.
https://repl.it/repls/LemonchiffonPrimeDrawing
It results in some error messages. They don’t match yours. Many of them say a lot about what needs to change.

I don’t quite understand the problem here. The codecademy  platform compiles and executes the code by itself, so I wanted to check it out in the real terminal and stumbled across an error. The part of the code I have issues is: std::vector even = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
the terminal identifies this line as an error and says this:
non-aggregate type ‘std::vector’ cannot be initialized with an initializer list

You can try to add the vector datatype, like std::vector<“datatype”> name = {values};
But then you will probably encounter another error. Depends on your compiler.
“[Error] could not convert ‘{2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9}’ from ‘’ to ‘std::vector’”
I got this and found out it was from my compiler because is a bug that has been fixed and my compiler is outdated. So, try this out.

Could you share the project url? So i can run the code (can’t find the project)

That doesn’t compile, which is something you need to look at before you consider how something behaves (you can’t even run it otherwise)
Same with warnings, always compile with -Wall to turn on warnings and if there are any then there’s no point considering behaviour of the program, something wrong has already been found.
And no it’s not exactly like the … (that’s not a hint that’s a complete program), so, you’ll need to modify your definition of the word exact to mean byte-for-byte-exactly-the-same-without-a-single-difference, indistinguishable. Exact doesn’t mean “looks the same”!

Doing division between two integers is going to result  in an integer. It would be weird if the result out of nowhere got a different type from the inputs, right?

Hi can anyone explain this piece of code below:
srand (time(NULL));

int computer = rand() % 3 + 1;

int user = 0;

I know that overall we use it for the computer to generate a random number, but I’m having trouble understanding this part why is  it rand() % 3 + 1
  int computer = rand() % 3 + 1;

","
Have you checked the documentation:
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/
are some good examples as well as an explanation:
A typical way to generate trivial pseudo-random numbers in a determined range using rand is to use the modulo of the returned value by the range span and add the initial value of the range.

hey @pyninja21220 this is great. i’m going to go back in and add more description in the course. this is in the Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock project, right?
also, here’s a livestream where i go over this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puMne8pqmxw
hope that helps!
(and five more modules coming after new years, so stay tuned  )

yes this is the rock paper lizard Spock project!

srand (time(NULL)) generates a random number; any number at all. int computer = rand () % 3 +1 assigns the random value to the computer for the rock-paper-scissors game. the modulus (%) gives the remainder of long division. in this case modulus any number will give a remainder of that number minus one, in this case it will output 0,1 or 2. we add one because we want the computer to have a value of 1,2 or 3 in this case. hope the mumbo jumbo helps

Many thanks! (Post must be at least 20 character)

Hey asiadecoder, I think you probably have to include the library   or <stdlib.h> to use pseudo random numbers.

Hi asiadecoder, I think you have to include the proper library to generate pseudorandom numbers.

Hello, @trinitycribbs.



 trinitycribbs:

It also keeps saying “married” was not declared in this scope.





 trinitycribbs:

if (maritalStatus == married)


You’ve declared maritalStatus as a string, so is married a variable with a string value assigned, or is it intended to be a string literal ""married"". It would appear to be the later.

@midlindner Okay so that fixed one problem, can’t believe I missed that:sweat_smile:

I haven’t tried running your code, but I’ve noticed lines such as this one:



 trinitycribbs:

taxableIncome = grossSalary - (mStEx + pensionPlan + pExemption)


pensionPlan and pExemption appear to be methods with required parameters. To get a value from the methods, you’ll have to call them: pensionPlan(argument1, argument2)
Then at the end of the method, instead of return 0; you’ll need to return the value expected. For example:
double pensionPlan (double grossSalary, double pensionFund)
{
    double pensionAmount;
    
    pensionAmount = grossSalary * pensionFund;
    return 0; //return pensionAmount;
//or even more concise: return grossSalary * pensionFund;
//if you used the second option, you could do away with the first 2 lines in this method
}


@midlindner omg, that’s the same mistake I made with my last project, I can’t believe I didn’t think of that! also your suggestion for cleaning up pensionPlan is much appreciated

63,When are pointers used and why,"Get Help,Git",references-pointers,7,"
I dont get it why i should use pointers in my projects. Is it just me or me not that advanced to use them.
","
From the lesson on pointers:

The purpose of the lesson seems to be, so you’ll recognize what a pointer is and how it works if you see it in older code. There really isn’t a reason to use pointers anymore.




 midlindner:

There really isn’t a reason to use pointers anymore.


That doesn’t sound right to me.
References can’t be dereferenced, they are much less powerful
May as well use java/equivalent at that point, right?

Perhaps it’d be more fair to say that STL deals with most common application logic where one might otherwise use pointers?
As an example, vectors are much easier to deal with than arrays because with arrays one has to deal with making sure it’s on the heap so that it can be passed around with copying, plus having to malloc and free it and then if for some reason one wants to change the shape of it then hahaha have fun with that.

I agree that my previous comment was a bit hasty. From some very recent research spurred by your comment, I can see where an experienced programmer might find pointers very useful. I’m not sure that dereferencing is one of them. As I understand it, dereferencing is simply accessing the value stored at the 'pointed to ’ memory location. Could you expound what the difference you’ve referred to is?




 ionatan:

References can’t be dereferenced


My wording is a bit backwards. Pointers are references as values, so you could for example keep a list of references (perhaps a pointer to where there are more pointers - an array), and you can do arithmetic on them too if you know the layout of the memory in that location.
Cpp references really only solve one problem: avoiding making a copy when making a function call.




 ionatan:

Not really.

When i writ the “g++” line to compile, do i need to press “Enter” to go underneath and type “./a.out” ?


That would be one way to do it.
As you mention, to compile your C++ program you need to do something like g++ my_code.cpp and then hit Enter to have the compiler build your program. You’ll then get a new line in the terminal.
So, if we did compile on the first line, press Enter, then do the command to execute on the second line our terminal would look like this:
$ g++ my_code.cpp
$ ./a.out

or, because Bash is pretty nifty, you can do both commands on one line like so:
$ g++ my_code.cpp; ./a.out

That command gets bash to run the compiler (g++ my_code.cpp), before executing the resulting program (./a.out).
Does that help you? 

Thanks alot, Its my first time learning c++

No worries.

When I use codecademy, the terminal has never worked so far, always because of the same error:

That’s working a whole lot. Look at the command you ran, there are indeed two main’s in what you specified.

66,Reference parameter with default value in a function,"Get Help,Git",functions-c,2,"
Hi there,
I’ve just finished the pointers/references chapter and I wonder how can I create a function declaration that has a typesafe null reference as a default value?
Something like:
void square(int &num = NULL){
    if(num == NULL){
        std::cout << ""Here goes nothing!"" << std::endl;
    } else {
        num*=num;
    }
}

I used “NULL” because I don’t know what else I should use… 
Cheers

I guess it wouldn’t make sense, since references can’t be changed once assigned… but anyways, curious to know.

67,"""Classes and Objects"" section question","Get Help,Git",,2,"
What’s the point of having both the song.cpp file and the song.hpp file?
It seems like the content in the .cpp file is just a more detailed version of what’s in the .hpp file. For example, song.cpp has:
void Song::add_title(std::string new_title) {

  title = new_title;

and song.hpp has
void add_title(std::string new_title);

Why do we need both?
","
I’m a bit rusty on the inner workings of the C++ compiler, but here goes…
The reason for the header files is because of how the C++ compiler creates the final program.
When you compile your C++ program, each .cpp file is individually compiled into its own compilation unit. When the compilation is complete, a separate program - the linker - joins the compilation units together into the complete program.
The compiler doesn’t know or care about which names are declared in which compilation unit. All it does is convert your C++ to machine code that the CPU understands. So, if you wanted to create a C++ class and use it across multiple source .cpp files you would need to declare the exact same object in every .cpp where you wanted to use it.
This, equally, means that if you wanted to change it you have to change it everywhere, and a single mistake in any one file that contains that declaration will cause errors for the linker.
Instead, by declaring the function/class/whatever in the header file (e.g. my_stuff.hpp) we can tell any .cpp file which needs to know about it what that function/class/object looks like - i.e. what type it returns, what its parameters are etc - using a single point of reference.
You then implement the function/class/whatever in a separate file, my_stuff.cpp, which includes the header - #include ""my_stuff.hpp"". The compiler literally copies-and-pastes that header into the source at compile time, merging the two into a single compilation unit to be passed to the linker. The end result is we have a single declaration of some_function(), a single implementation of some_function(), and no problems for the linker.
Say you had a source file superfunction.cpp which needs a function you’ve defined in utilities.cpp. By including the header utilities.hpp, you can tell superfunction.cpp about the basic structure of the objects declared in utilities.cpp. The actual functionality of those objects is incorporated into your final program by the linker, when it links the compilation units for superfunction.cpp and utilities.cpp.
That hopefully makes sense… it’s been a while since I’ve had to explain any of this.
If you’re confused, I’m sorry! If you search for information about how C++ compilation works, it should become clearer about why the headers are there and how they’re useful.

68,C++ example template incorrect?,"Get Help,Git",,3,"
Ok, so here is the example given for how to create a template in C++:

template 
void print_cat_ears(T item) {
std::cout << "" "" << item << ""   "" << item << "" "" << “\n”;
std::cout << item << item << item << "" "" << item << item << item << “\n”;
}

However, in the exercise accompanying this lesson, in place of void for the function, it is T.
Can you use void as well or in order for a template to work should you also use T there?
Thank you for any help!
","
A template defines a generic type - we don’t know what type it will be
template  < typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a+b;
}

template <typename T>
void print_add(T a, T b) {
    std::cout << a+b;
}

T means some sort of generic data type - could be an integer, a float, a character
void means - this function does not return any sort of data type!
the function add takes two generic arguments a and b
add(3,4)
Compiler: ok two integers - lets add them and return an integer
it returns the implied datatype integer with the value 7
add(3.0, 4.0)
Compiler: ok two floats - lets add them and return a float
it returns the implied datatype float with the value 7.0
the function print_add is Void it doesn’t return any value it just prints the result of adding two T’s to the screen

First, If you could re-post your code, so that it is formatted as code, that will help others to read it more easily. To do so, you can type 3 back tics on the line above your code, and on the line below your code like so:
```
Paste your code here.
```

thanks i edit the post

Ok. The function needs to return a vector, so to define your function, the first thing you have to do is declare the data type that it will return which in this case is a vector containing integers. Like so:
std::vector<int> first_three_multiples(int num) {
  //function code here
}

The body of your current function won’t accomplish the task. The pre-written code provided will test your function by passing in the value: 8. You won’t need to assign 8 to a new variable, you just use the num parameter included in your function declaration. What you need to do is multiply num by 1 then 2 then 3 to get the first 3 multiples: 8, 16, 24. Those values should be stored in a vector of type int. Then return the vector. To declare an empty vector of type int you use the following syntax: std::vector<int> myVector;
You can then add values to the vector with the .push_back() method or you can assign the values when you declare the vector like so: std::vector<int> myVector = {value1, value2, value3}; Give it a try. Good luck!

i get this , what i dont understand where go :   std::vector myVector;
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Define first_three_multiples() here:
std::vector<int> first_three_multiples(int num) {
  
//std::vector<int> multiples{num, num * 2, num * 3};
  // este es el vector declarado
  int vector [] ={num, num * 2, num * 3};
return vector;
}

int main() {
  
  for (int element : first_three_multiples(8)) {
    std::cout << element << ""\n"";
  }
  
}






 designrunner85859:

//std::vector<int> multiples{num, num * 2, num * 3};



Un-comment the above line, and delete the following:



 designrunner85859:

int vector [] ={num, num * 2, num * 3};



Then change return vector; to return multiples;, and I believe you’ll have it 

Sorry, I missed one thing:



 designrunner85859:

//std::vector<int> multiples{num, num * 2, num * 3};
//             need = here ^



You need an = between multiples and {}

int main() {
  
  for (int element : first_three_multiples(8)) {
    std::cout << element << ""\n"";
  }

Could you explain me how the ‘for loop’ (a small part of the question) works? (As far as I remember this is not taught till this part of the course.)

for loops in general in all programming languages are most often used to iterate over an enumerable data structure like an array or in the case of this lesson a vector. The syntax used in this lesson is a little more advanced than usual. In the example, int element is a variable that will contain the values returned by the range on the right side of the :. The range in this case is a function called first_three_multiples. The function returns a vector, and the for loop assigns each element or value included in the vector to the variable named element one at a time. It takes the first value from the vector, performs whatever actions are inside the for loop’s code block, then repeats those actions for the second value, third value, etc. until it reaches the end of the range. In this example there are only 3 values in the vector, and the only action inside the code block is to print the value to the console using std::cout. Hopefully this makes sense. Here’s a link regarding the use of the : in the loop if you’d like to investigate further: https://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-ranged-for-loop.html

Thank you for this! This was definitely not in any of the lessons so far, but you explained it perfectly! Well, for me at least!

71,C++ Code Challenge : Palindrome,"Get Help,Git",,5,"
Hi, in the Palindrome challenge I had to check the solution from the beginning because I didn´t know how to treat the string.
Is a string treated like a vector of characters?
If that´s the case, why can we use ‘+’ to add characters instead of using .push_back?
Can somebody point me to the lesson where all of this stuff about strings is explained previously in order to be able to solve the challenge without watching the solution? Thank you.
","
A string is an abstraction of an array of characters.
We use operators like + because we want to treat a string like a string, not a container. That is why the abstraction exists.
Working with a string should sound like english. ""Hey Add the text ’ world’ to that ‘hello’ ""
We wouldn’t say push that text back there. push_back makes sense if you think of a container, push this box to the back of the container.

I see, makes sense…but in which lesson is all of this explained? The vector lesson talks about the .size() method but I couldn´t find anything related to strings.

Don’t know, or if it even is.
The big takeaway is a String is a String,  a Vector is a Vector
A String is a type with methods to work on its data - it defines a + operator to add more chars
A Vector is a type designed to hold other types it has it’s own methods to do things with its data
A Vector holds a bunch of strings
Vector defines push_back to add more strings
You could add a string to a vector and also add chars to that string in the vector

Ok, thank you…but I don´t think it makes sense to ask to solve a problem with knowledge that hasn´t been explained previously, this last exercise should be changed or deleted unless the knowledge required to solve it is explained in a previous lesson of this same course.

THANK YOU @patrickd314 for this!!
Code that is posted without the indentations, whitespace and special characters preserved, is very difficult to read, and cannot easily be tested by those trying to help you.
The Codecademy forum provides a quick and easy way to post properly-formatted code. All you need to do is look for the </> icon in the menu bar which appears at the top of the text box while you type.

Press Enter to go to a blank line, click that icon, and you will see this:

Just copy and paste your code directly from the editor into that highlighted portion, and all of the nicely-readable formatting will be preserved! Moreover, it will be in a format that can be directly copied and pasted into an IDE for testing.
The same icon can be used for highlighting small code snippets in-line for clarity.


If you will reply with your code formatted using the </> button, and include a link to the specific exercise you are working on, I’ll see what I can do.

Besides the missing includes, copy and pasting code could cause issues with ascii characters not being recognized especially double quotes. Furthermore just because it was on a coding website doesn’t at all mean that it is correct, efficient or safe.
(bb - 4ac)) / (2a);
That bit of code looks absolutely wrong

The markup for the forum converts what is between the *'s to itallics, and you don’t see the *'s. They are there.

@beta5554413037,  proper formatting for the forum aside, your code does work when I run it in the Codecademy https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-plus-plus/projects/cpp-quadratic-formula project. Is it possible that you didn’t click Save prior to compiling?

Thanks for the hint! I was staring blind at this apperently.
I modified the loop, but it still did not pass validation until i removed the std::cout for it to verify.
Could you perhaps explain why the strings looked the same when printing them but did not match?
Thanks once again, now I can get moving 

If they don’t compare as equal then they’re probably not the same.
So you’d want to inspect their data as opposed to … eyeballing whatever shows up on screen.
Printing out the bytes is one option. Using a debugger is another.
(If you haven’t already) you’re going to want to figure out where the extra character came from to better understand how to fix it next time it happens, or perhaps even learn to avoid it (but realistically you are going to introduce something like this quite often when dealing with cpp, especially as a beginner. As you get more experienced you learn to eliminate scenarios where these mistakes can exist by abstracting away the dirty details…There’ll always be bugs though)

82,[C++] Need help with cin input,"Get Help,Git",,5,"
Sup there
So i’m having a problem with cin input :
char t;
cout << ""It's your turn (you have "" << tries << "" tries left): "";
cin >> t;

Problem is that the user is able to input more than 1 character on the console even tho it’s a “char” type and my program keep looping like if he put “test” in the input it gonna loop 4 times. But that’s not what i want. I want it to only get the first char from the input.
How i can limit the cin input on the program ?
Thanks
","
You can’t limit the input. (How would you do that, unplug the keyboard, hit the user over their head?) But you can ignore it. Clear the buffer.
Or if as you say you want only the first character, then don’t do it on a loop. Read one character, and not any more.
Maybe all you’re really looking for is: read the whole line. This is easier than figuring out how much input is queued up so if you don’t care beyond that, then look no further. It’s quite likely that you don’t have any need for anything else, because when you see a linebreak then you know you’re in sync (because the user probably types a whole lot slower than you process the input, they won’t have had time to press another key) with the user because the input is line buffered, it’s flushed every time a line ends, the de-sync comes from when the user is typing before having ended the line. Another alternative is to change the buffering mode so that you’re in sync with every key press, but, again, you can’t limit the input, there can always be purposefully badly formed input.

To get you the point here is the project : https://github.com/CharlesCpp/Hanged-Man
On thehangedman.cpp
If you compile the program and start it you would be able to input multiple char when asking for the user input once the game started. But i find no way to control that.

While it would be really cool if you could write code that would unplug the keyboard, and hit the user over the head for intentionally not following instructions as @ionatan suggested  , another solution might be to require a single character through code. For example:
#include <iostream>
using std::string;
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
  string letter;
  while (letter.length() != 1)
  {
    cout << endl << ""Type a single letter and press <enter>: "";
    cin >> letter;
  }
  cout << endl << ""You chose: "" << letter << endl;
  return 0;
}

Basically just write a function to validate the input before continuing on.

I’ll just repeat myself.
You cannot prevent the user from typing.
But you can ignore what they type.
You probably mean the second, but you’re expressing it in terms of the first, and trying to write code for that is not possible. Writing code for the second one is very possible. Read the input, and don’t do anything with it. Or change the buffering mode. Pretty sure I already covered it all, not even sure why I’m typing this in >.>

83,Need help with First Three Multiples,"Get Help,Git",,4,"
Hi guys, I am currently on C++ module First Three Multiples Tut.
I have looked at ranged based for loops a bit to understand the for loop at the bottom, but I am stuck on why my code outputs so many 0’s. Could anyone explain to me why, and what I should do instead?
My aim for this tut is to print out 3 values of multiples of 8. 8 (81). 16 (82). 24 (8*3).
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Define first_three_multiples() here:

std::vector <int> first_three_multiples(int num)
{
	std::vector<int> ftm(num);
	for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
	{
		ftm.push_back(num * i);
	}
	return ftm;
}

int main() {

for (int element : first_three_multiples(8)) {
		std::cout << element << ""\n"";
	}
	return 0;
}

Cheers.

Hello, welcome to the forum 
This is the crucial line:
std::vector<int> ftm(num);

take a look at the reference -> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/vector/, this is the part that relates to this situation:

explicit vector (size_type n, const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());
vector (size_type n, const value_type& val, const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());
Constructs a container with  n  elements. Each element is a copy of  val  (if provided).

This means that in this line of code you have created a vector of type int with num (in case of this snippet num = 8) elements. Vector initialises all the elements and the default value for int is 0. That is why in the output you get eight zeros 
To fix this problem you can simply omit the size_type parameter:
std::vector<int> ftm;


Small digression that can be ignored.
But this should lead us to a question - why there is a way to specify the number of elements at the creation time of the vector - its length is extendable, right? Right. But when you initialise vector without specifying the size then with every push_back there might be a need to allocate memory (and this takes time). And sometimes this is what we want - sometimes we simply do not know how many elements will be in the vector.
But in case of this function, we are sure that we will push_back only 3 values. But we do not want to start with three zeros, we don’t know the values, we have to calculate them. In this scenario we can use reserve method to allocate memory for three int values:
std::vector<int> ftm;
ftm.reserve(3);


Thanks for your response.
Are there any advantages to reserving the capacity verses to initializing the vector with int 0 as elements by default?

You’re very welcome 
If there is a high probability that many of the values will remain zeros then it might be better to initialize with zeros (or with any other value passed as a second parameter).
But when you don’t have any prior knowledge of what kind of values you will place inside the vector then it’s better to just reserve space for them.
It is pretty intuitive - the fewer operations a computer needs to execute, the faster the code will be.

87,What are the differences between references and pointers?,"Get Help,Git",,2,"
I’m confused between the two. Thanks for any help !
","
Both references and pointers can be used to change local variables of one function inside another function. Both of them can also be used to save copying of big objects when passed as arguments to functions or returned from functions, to get efficiency gain.
Despite above similarities, there are following differences between references and pointers.
References are less powerful than pointers

Once a reference is created, it cannot be later made to reference another object; it cannot be reseated. This is often done with pointers.
References cannot be NULL. Pointers are often made NULL to indicate that they are not pointing to any valid thing.
A reference must be initialized when declared. There is no such restriction with pointers

Due to the above limitations, references in C++ cannot be used for implementing data structures like Linked List, Tree, etc. In Java, references don’t have above restrictions, and can be used to implement all data structures. References being more powerful in Java, is the main reason Java doesn’t need pointers.
References are safer and easier to use:

Safer: Since references must be initialized, wild references like wild pointers are unlikely to exist. It is still possible to have references that don’t refer to a valid location (See questions 5 and 6 in the below exercise )
Easier to use: References don’t need dereferencing operator to access the value. They can be used like normal variables. ‘&’ operator is needed only at the time of declaration. Also, members of an object reference can be accessed with dot operator (‘.’), unlike pointers where arrow operator (->) is needed to access members.

 pepperdev:

for (int i = text.size() - 1; i >= 0; i–) {
reversed_text += text[i];
}



Typically in a for loop you would start at 0, and iterate forwards or upwards to the end of an array or in this case a string. Because i is initially assigned a value equal to the length or size of the string (number of characters in the string) like so:int i = text.size() - 1 we are starting from the last character, and iterating backwards or downwards to the beginning of the string.
Let’s take “ada” for example. A string is essentially an array of characters, so the character at index 0 is ‘a’, at index 1 is ‘d’ and at index 2 is ‘a’. (indexes start at 0)
The .size() of “ada” is 3, but there is no character at index 3, so we initialize the index variable to .size() - 1 to account for that: for (int i = text.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--). Now while i >= 0 we add the character at index i to the reversed_text variable, and then subtract 1 from i.
Hope this helps!

What is the meaning of ‘+=’ symbol in the above question?

With regards to string values (text) += is a concatenation operator. It adds or ‘appends’ the value on the right to the existing value on the left. It is basically shorthand for: reversed_text = reversed_text + text[i]

Hello, @nicolasa2776731346!
Let’s look at an example:
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::string text = ""cat"";
  std::string reversed_text = """";

//text.size() is 3 since 'cat' has 3 characters
//the indexes of those 3 characters are accessible
//using [] like this: text[0]
//the character at the index 0 is 'c'
//so text[0] refers to 'c', text[1] refers to 'a'
//and text[2] refert to 't'

  for (int i = text.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { 
  //we start out with i equal to 2 since: (3 - 1 = 2)
  //we want to start at 2 because 2 is the index for the last character in text
  //so text[2] is 't'

    reversed_text += text[i];
    //reversed_text was empty, but now has a value of 't'
    //because we added 't' to the end of its previous value
    //of """"
  }
  //the code inside of the { } above repeats as long as i
  //is greater than or equal to 0 because of the second
  //expression in our for loop: (i >= 0;)
  //this will cause text[1] which is 'a'
  //and text[0] which is 'c' to be added
  //in turn to the end of reversed_text the
  //same way that text[2] which was 't' was added
  //once i is less than 0, the loop stops executing, and
  //the lines of code below are executed

  std::cout << ""Original value of text: "" << text << ""\n"";
  std::cout << ""Value of reversed_text: "" << reversed_text;
}

Output:

Original value of text: cat
Value of reversed_text: tac

Hopefully this helps!

Here’s the way I coded this challenge, maybe it’ll make sense to you.  Instead of creating a reverse string this code tests the two ends of the original text to see if they match.  If they do, it assigns true to the bool val and then moves in one spot on both sides of the original text.  It will do this until it hits or passes the middle of the word, which is why in the for loop the second parameter is i < text.size()/2.  If at any time the function finds two letters that don’t match, it returns false ending the function.  At the end, if all matches were true the function will return val which is true.  Let me know if more explanation is needed.
#include 
// Define is_palindrome() here:
bool is_palindrome(std::string text) {
bool val;
for(int i = 0; i < text.size()/2; i++) {
if(text[i] == text[text.size()-1-i]) {
val = true;
}
else {
return false;
}
}
return val;
}
int main() {
std::cout << is_palindrome(“madam”) << “\n”;
std::cout << is_palindrome(“ada”) << “\n”;
std::cout << is_palindrome(“lovelace”) << “\n”;
}

Hello, @blog2881331944! Welcome to the forum.
That is another way to do it. You could refactor your code to make it even more efficient like so:
SPOILER:

#include <iostream>

// Define is_palindrome() here:
bool is_palindrome(std::string text) {

  for(int i = 0; i < text.size()/2; i++) {
    if(text[i] != text[text.size()-1-i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {

std::cout << is_palindrome(""madam"") << ""\n"";
std::cout << is_palindrome(""ada"") << ""\n"";
std::cout << is_palindrome(""lovelace"") << ""\n"";
}

When you select the index in a string, like you are doing with normal[i], the result type is a char.

The reason for the error is that you are trying to push a char value into an array that is expecting a value with the type string.

You will still get the error because the value is still a char.
You have to either convert the char value to a string or change the result vector type to char.

let input = “'hi, human”;
const vowels = [“a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u”];
let resultArray = ;
for (let i=0; i <input.length; i++){
for (let j=0; j<vowels.length; j++){
if ( input[i] === vowels[j] && input[i] === “e” ) {
resultArray.push(input[i] + input[i] );
}
else if ( input[i] === vowels[j] && input[i] === “u” ){
resultArray.push(input[i] + input[i] );
}
else if( input[i] === vowels[j] ){
resultArray.push(input[i]);
}
}
}
Can somebody please tell me how the 2 for loop works? For example first letter of input is “h” and  vowel’s first letter is “a”. when it checks for the second letter in input the letter “i” the 2nd letter in the array is “e” so they aren’t equal. Therefore somehow it pushes that letter into the empty array after its been evaluated that i exists in vowels array?

92,Dog Years output goes beyond million problem,"Get Help,Git",,3,"
Hi, currently im in the C++ dog years section course. it all went smoothly, therefore i thought i could make an improvement by adding an input and such, and it all goes well even after compiling and executing the program. as being showed below is the code i improvise:
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  
  int dog_age, x, y, z;
  
  /*
  x= early years > 2 years
  y= later years > following years
  z= human years > total human years
  */
  
  x = 21;
  y = (dog_age - 2)*4;
  z = x + y;
  
  std::cout << ""Insert your dog age"";
  
  std::cin >> dog_age;
  
  std::cout << ""this dog is "" << dog_age << "" years old, which means "" << z << "" years old in human years"";

}

the problem im experiencing is when the dog to human age is being showed by a wrong answer and it goes beyond million, for example after inserting the amount of dog years which mine is 5, then the converted dog years to human years is  -656219955.

Was doing the 8-Ball probably just fine but wanted to try something extra to see how it would work.
Wanted to have the program ask the user what their question was. It would store it, but ultimately not use it. Just to make it seem like you were actually asking something. When I run the code though, it never prompts the user to enter a question and just runs the if statements right away. I rearranged some of the code but I’m not sure what’s going on. Is there an order about IF statements that I have not learned yet? Curious.

I tried the same thing some time ago. The problem is not with your code. If you run it in another environment like on repl.it. You’ll see that it works as you would expect. The issue is that in the environment set up by Codecademy for this lesson, std::cin is disabled. The computer just skips over that line without executing it. I ran your code on repl.it, and it works perfectly! Happy Coding!
P.S. When you paste your code into a post on the forum, please click the </> icon first. Then paste your code in the space indicated. That will preserve your formatting, and make your code much easier to read.

Thanks, I was wondering if that was the case as I have noticed a few other instances where I’m trying some code that I think would work but it does not within the lesson environment. Good to know that I’m not crazy. I will use the code tool for posts from now on too!

96,I have a problem in assigning values to objects,"Get Help,Git",,6,"
Here is the link of the lesson: https://gist.github.com/2772f4da7de29d0e0b7282afcaae42da
The second point of the lesson instructed me to Use  Song ‘s built-in  .add_title()  method to add a title to  electric_relaxation :  ""Electric Relaxation"" .
In the theory of the lesson it is said:
We can give the object’s attributes values like this (note that these must be attributes you defined in the class):
accra.population = 2270000;

So I wrote
 electric_relaxation.title = ""Electric Relaxation"";

My program was incorrect (it gave a cross mark at the second point).
In the solution
 'electric_relaxation.add_title(""Electric Relaxation"");' was given.

Where am I wrong?
Edit: I did not format the question properly.
","
The instruction specifically said to use the .add_title() method, which is a special type of method that object-oriented programming (OOP) enthusiasts call a “setter”, because it sets an object attribute.
What you did was to directly set the attribute, using the object name and dot notation. You can do that in Python (but not in some other languages), but it is not recommended, and the aforementioned OOP enthusiasts insist upon always using a setter (and it’s counterpart, a “getter”.)

Why is it not recommended? I think that it is easier to directly set the attribute than declaring another variable and doing it indirectly.

If that’s all an object is, then I agree with you, and get pretty annoyed when such code has getters/setters.
You can think of methods as message handlers. The object can act however it pleases to the messages it gets, as opposed to having its memory accessed directly. The object is then free to do integrity checks on actions suggested to it, and perhaps the context of the object is such that it needs to react to changes.

Sorry, I couldn’t understand what you said in the second paragraph(You can think of methods as message handlers. …).
Could you illustrate the point you were trying to explain to me?

Many people agree with you.
I’d bet that the people who composed the Codecademy Python courses - at least those parts dealing with OOP - come from a Java background. You could take a dozen Python courses and never see the words getter or setter.

It’s been a while since I’ve done anything with C++, but I have a suspicion that what’s happening is simply your compiler being kind by recognising that std::string is part of the C++ standard library and pulling the appropriate header file in for you automatically in the background.
I don’t think it’s referenced in any of the other headers you’re using (<iostream> and <vector>, from the standard library) so can’t see any other way of it finding its way in to your program.
You shouldn’t rely on the compiler to “notice” omissions from the std library and correct them, though - so yes, I’m fairly sure the solution ought to include #include <string> somewhere as you suggest.
(The last time I used C++ was in '09, so apologies in advance for any mistakes!)

Please see my comments above. Also, as written, your else statement is terminated by the semicolon, and std::cout << ""Paper beats rock, you win!\n""; is a statement all on its own. It gets executed every time your code runs. Remember that else statements do not have conditions. If you want to test another condition you need else if (condition) {code block}

101,Sorting Hat quiz question,"Get Help,Git",,2,"
I’m going through the Sorting Hat project, and I’m a bit confused on something. If the max variable is just being used as a placeholder for a value of zero, and letting us say gryffindor is greater than 0, I’ve discovered that max can be called anything. I even changed it from max to “steve” and it still worked. It’s soley to give it a placeholder for 0 from my understanding. What I’m lost on is why we need to say max = gryffindor; in the if statement curly braces. If the house name is greater than zero, the IF’s curly braces still tell the house string variable to correspond with it. As you can see in the picture I left all those out and it’s still running as expected. Is this just good practice to include this sort of thing in case you would need to call the max function later? Am I missing something?? 
Screen Shot 2019-06-17 at 8.51.45 PM.png395×519 26.6 KB

","
It’s not the string house that is greater than max, it’s one of the integers (gryffindor, hufflepuff, slytherin or ravenclaw) that you declared at the beginning, where you add the points to. the string is used after you know which house has won, you can give that string the name of the house that won and then use that to output the house name, without having to make different cases for the different winner.
ie. ravenclaw has the most points, you give the string house the name ravenclaw, then you can say std::cout << house << “won!” as an output.

Just trying to figure out some examples of when we would need to repeat a section of code.


Lets say we have a giant list of contact information. The information you are getting in this list per contact is a name and a gender. Now a customer want’s this information in two documents. One document for female contact’s and another document of male contacts.
These are millions of contact’s so it would be impossible to do by hand.
But, to recognize if someone is male or female is very simple. you just have to do it over and over again.
Instead of creating an if statement for every one of the million contacts to check if they are male/female we just loop trough all the data and check the data while it loops over it.
I don’t know c++ so here is an example in pseudo code:
for every contact in the contactlist:   // <-- the loop
    if contact is male:
        add contact to male.document;
    if contact is female:
        add contact to female.document;

As you can see its way less work to simply write this than to check every data entry yourself.
eventually all a loop does is give you the ability to get every data entry separately which in turn allows you to put a check on or use this data.
When i use a loop i know the following things:

the checks i perform are always the same for all data entries i loop over.
the amount of data that needs to be checked could change.

There could be more reasons to use a loop tho. It is just a tool like you use a knife to cut bread. When you are creating code and you feel like your doing the same thing over and over. You could probably use a loop in this instance.
Hope it helps. Don’t have an answer for your second question.

Quick simple example of why you might use a while loop. Say you have a list of thousands of songs, and you want to randomly choose 20 of them for a playlist:
#include <iostream>;
#include <vector>;

int main() {
  std::vector<std::string> playlist;
  
  while (playlist.size() < 20) {
    //logic to randomly choose a song, and add it to the playlist vector
    //this code block will repeat until you have 20 songs in the vector
  }

  return 0;
}

The program appears to be working as intended when I run it.
Can you elaborate what it is that you don’t expect, or if what you expect, that isn’t happening

Edit: I just ran it through a different compiler and it worked fine. It was only when running it through the Codecademy terminal that it was bypassing everything.
Well, as I had mentioned, it’s bypassing the user input I was expecting when using std::cin >>. Instead of me being able to enter in the days and true/false for whether it’s a succulent, it’s going straight to the else statement of “Don’t water the plant.”

Sorry about that…

It seems the SCT is expecting the parameter names in addition to the types in your parameter lists:
double average(double num1, double num2);
int tenth_power(int num);
bool is_palindrome(std::string text);

Hope this helps!

107,Temperature lesson problem,"Get Help,Git",,3,"
Hi there,
Having an issue with Challenge: Temperature (Part 2); even though I am typing exactly what is in the hints I get weird outputs -
1)program supposed to ask for temp input in fahrenheit and doesn’t
2) gives answer of -17.7778 degrees celsius every time.
This seems like an error with the lesson.
Edit: definitely a problem with the lesson, just tried with compiler and works. If this is the quality of codecademy lessons will not be upgrading to pro.

108,What is wrong with my palindrome function?,"Get Help,Git",,3,"
Hi,
I am a newcomer about C++ and I am stuck with the  exercise for Palindrome function.
Below is my code:
bool is_palindrome(std::string text) {
std::string reversed_text = “”;
for (int i=0; text.size(); i++) {
reversed_text[i] = text[text.size()-i];
}
if (reversed_text == text ) {
return true;
}
else {
return false;
}
}
int main() {
std::cout << is_palindrome(“madam”) << “\n”;
std::cout << is_palindrome(“ada”) << “\n”;
std::cout << is_palindrome(“lovelace”) << “\n”;
}
Does anyone can tell me which part is wrong?
Thanks!
","
You have a few issues to address.
First, reversed_text is initialized to an empty string. In this statement reversed_text[i] = text[text.size()-i]; reversed_text[i] doesn’t exist. There is no position or index in an empty string. You can add the character to the empty string using the += operator.
Second, in the same statement reversed_text[i] = text[text.size()-i]; the expression text[text.size()-i] is not giving you what you want. The size() of “madam” is 5, but the last character “m” is not at index 5, it’s at index 4. Indexes start at 0. If you subtract 1 from the results of your current expression, you’ll get the proper index.
Third, for (int i=0; text.size(); i++) isn’t doing what you expect for the same reason as previously mentioned. text.size(); is the stop condition for your loop. The text.size() for “madam” is 5, but the indexes for the characters in “madam” are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. You’ll want to continue iterating while i < text.size().
I’ve included your original code with the necessary changes below. Please try correcting your code before peeking 

bool is_palindrome(std::string text) {
  std::string reversed_text = """";

  for (int i=0; i < text.size(); i++) {
    reversed_text += text[text.size() - 1 -i];
  }

  if (reversed_text == text ) {
    return true;
  }
  else {
    return false;
  }
}

int main() {

std::cout << is_palindrome(""madam"") << ""\n"";
std::cout << is_palindrome(""ada"") << ""\n"";
std::cout << is_palindrome(""lovelace"") << ""\n"";

}


One last thing. Your method for reversing the text works, but the more orthodox method would be like this:

for (int i = text.size() -1; i >= 0; i--) { //start i at the end, and iterate backwards
  reversed_text += text[i];
}


Just food for thought. Your method works too.
Hope this helps! && Happy coding!

Practice. I was thought to code at least 1 hour a day to stay sharp. Go make something or do some code-challenges.
It is never sure what type of work you are going to do when you start your job. So keep practicing general things and stay open to new things and be prepared to keep learning.

Take CS50. It’s only $99. And it gives you a certification.




 objectblaster53030:

but I want to be able to get a job by the end of the year.


What type of job? Practice, like what @biirra said is good to make you can remember it, but for most jobs C++ isn’t enough. Have you taken any other languages?

Review each course, and make sure to do others for most jobs will require more than one language. Maybe try Python.

Java would be a decent course since its similar in some ways toward C++.

Startups, Like the one I own, Would definitely be willing to hire you if you are a hard worker.

Where do you find startups that are willing to hire with little-to no job experience? I know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js (express, react, ejs… ect…), A bit of C type languages (C/C#/C++). I’ve been working every day to learn but where to go next? to find one of these startups willing to accept someone like me?

Why don’t you take some courses at a Community College?

You find them by applying to all of them. Here is a story of a fellow codecadamy learner who made a very inspiring story of his journey.
Also don’t worry to much about no job experience. If you have a portfolio to show they usually don’t care that much. Just keep trying. If you get rejected you can always ask why and than you know where you need to improve.

Hey everyone,
So I’ve read everyone’s answers. Thank you so much for writing in, it means a lot.
And since asking this question, I’ve come up with a plan. I’m going to do the python and website design courses, as well as git. and then I’m going to take CS50. In the mean time, I’m also going to try katas on codewars.com.

110,Having trouble with the functions code challenge 'introduction',"Get Help,Git",,5,"
My code gives the correct output (Knowles, Beyonce Knowles) but for some reason I’m told it is incorrect.
Here is my code:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
// Define introduction() here:
void introduction(string first_name, string last_name){
cout << last_name << "", "" << first_name << "" "" << last_name << endl;
}
int main() {
introduction(“Beyonce”, “Knowles”);
}
Any help is much appreciated!
","
Sometimes even when your code is correct, and will work perfectly, it doesn’t match the solution that the lesson is looking for. It appears that to earn the check mark to pass this challenge you have to use the expected syntax:
void introduction(std::string first_name, std::string last_name) {
  //code here
}

Your using namespace std; statement would be the preferred way to do it in a real world scenario, but this particular lesson is expecting the above.
Of course you’ll then also have to use std::cout and std::endl. It’s a pain, I know.

Ah I see. Thank you so much!

I originally learned some C++ from a few other venues several years ago. Don’t use it much, so I’m rusty. I proceeded to the next challenge, and found that you cannot enter any code that will pass without clicking the ‘Solution’ button. When I did, the solution was the same as my code. I copied the solution, reset the exercise, pasted the solution back in, and it still won’t pass. I have found a few cases like this in other languages on Codecademy. I submitted a ‘Bug Report’, and suggest you do the same if you have the same results I just did. Hopefully they’ll fix it. Good Luck! && Happy Coding!

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-plus-plus/lessons/cpp-code-challenge-functions/exercises/cpp-functions-cc-palindrome
This particular code challenge has an issue with the spelling of the word ‘palindrome’. When you start, you will see the following code in the editor:
#include <iostream>

// Define is_palidrome() here:


int main() {
  
  std::cout << is_palidrome(""madam"") << ""\n"";
  std::cout << is_palidrome(""ada"") << ""\n"";
  std::cout << is_palidrome(""lovelace"") << ""\n"";
  
}

Notice that ‘palindrome’ is spelled ‘palidrome’ throughout. In order to have your solution accepted without clicking the ‘Solution’ button, you’ll need to correct the spelling, and make sure to define your function as is_palindrome (spelled correctly). Hopefully this error will be fixed at some point @sonnynomnom.

It’s some really ugly C code written in CPP

In fact if you are trying to learn about a sorting algorithm it’s probably best to not even look at code unless you are proficient with the language.

First iteration of your for loop:
input[0] is ""t"" Since ""t"" isn’t in the vowel{} vector, and isn’t an ‘e’ or a ‘u’ neither or your if code blocks execute.
Second iteration:
input[1] is ""u"" Now as your code iterates through the vowel{} vector:
vowel[0] is ""a""  so… is ""u"" == ""a"" ? No.
is ""u"" == ""e"" or ""u""? Yes, so result is now {u}
Second iteration of  for (int j = 0; j < vowel.size(); j++)
vowel[1] is ""e"" and input[1] is still ""u""  so… is ""u"" == ""e""? No.
is ""u"" == ""e"" or ""u""? Yes, so result is now {uu}
Third iteration of  for (int j = 0; j < vowel.size(); j++)
vowel[2] is ""i"" and input[1] is still ""u""  so… is ""u"" == ""i""? No.
is ""u"" == ""e"" or ""u""? Yes, so result is now {uuu}
Fourth iteration of  for (int j = 0; j < vowel.size(); j++)
vowel[3] is ""o"" and input[1] is still ""u""  so… is ""u"" == ""o""? No.
is ""u"" == ""e"" or ""u""? Yes, so result is now {uuuu}
Fifth iteration of  for (int j = 0; j < vowel.size(); j++)
vowel[4] is ""u"" and input[1] is still ""u""  …so is ""u"" == ""u""? Yes, so result is now {uuuuu}
is ""u"" == ""e"" or ""u""? Yes, so result is now {uuuuuu}
See where this is going? The nested if in the first example makes a big difference. It is only checked when the input[i] matches vowel[j] instead of all 5 times through the vowel{} vector.
Hopefully that all made some sense.

Thanks a lot @midlindner for your detailed response. That cleared things up for me.

Or post all of the code for us to test it ourselves, I can imagine the error might not necessarily originate from ufo.cpp - but I never touched C++ myself, just putting this common procedure here for starters.

The other two code files:  (the code after this was in the file by default) and 

Look closely at your end_game() function in your ufo_functions.hpp file. If you don’t see it, click the spoiler below:

Missing ; at the end of your end_game(std::string answer, std::string codeword) function declaration.

In one of my books I read that it’s used “everywhere”. What does it mean? Is the washing machine written in c++? Or the microwave oven? The car radio? I’m really curious and want to find out more.
Note: the book didn’t mean “everywhere” as e.g. in games, systems etc. From context, it meant in everything.

I did a quick Google search and found out that you’ve guessed it right! Everything that has a microcontroller in it can be programmed with for example c++, c# or java (higher-level languages). You can find microcontrollers in any electric device you can think of. I find this very interesting!
The more you know 

Yes, it is used in all embedded systems. In today’s world, with the advent of IoT and entrance of embedded devices in almost all devices, programming is required. C++ is specifically used in all of these.
C++ is also used in device drivers.
Also, Linux is fully based on C language, so you can literally do anything with C/C++.

In this line:
std::vectorstd::string grocery = {“Hot Pepper Jam”, “Dragon Fruit”, “Brussel Sprouts”};

you initialized new vector grocery with 3 values. Later you added four next elements with push_back method.
3 + 4 = 7 

So when I write .push_back - I add new values, and it isn’t the same?

Here is the documentation for std::vector::push_back -> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/push_back/.

Adds a new element at the end of the vector, after its current last element.

So, when you use push_back the argument is added as a new element at the end of the vector and the size of the vector is incremented by one.

C++ is FINALLY here on CodeCademy, but what is it used for? General


    What?! Wow! This is great! 
So pretty much the whole C series, C, C++, and C# are just console languages that have a pile of fun libraries for you to work with, and they are pretty related in a way with JavaScript. 
In fact, C++ is actually a really fast language, and Python is a complete turtle compared to this language.
  





C++ is FINALLY here on CodeCademy, but what is it used for? General


    Loved C++ back in college. Can’t wait to refresh my memory. Thank you codeacademy!!! 


I personally like it so far myself!
I hope this helps =)

Yeah I was excited when I got the email about it. Then I did it and was like “that’s it”? There’s almost no content. Pretty disappointing if you ask me.

They Will be adding More Content as time goes on. This will definitely help to get the Syntax Down.

Yea. It did seem a little short. I would guess, yes, that they would add more coursework to it.

Well, as stated by one of the CC Leader (I think it is his position), the course is getting new modules in these weeks so be patient and enjoy 
Also, remember than everything about learning a programming language start with the basis (Variable Types, I/O, Loops, Conditionals), this is what CC does, as learning platform to people who doesn’t know how to code or want to move to new programming stuff 

Yeah I’ve only taken like 2 quizzes and it seems so to me as well, but that’s probably because it’s new. Like, it says that I’m at 33% complete but literally all I’ve learned is how to write and run hello.cpp
I mean, I don’t think it’s a bad thing; that’s actually how I like to learn a new programming language is to relearn the basics of programming,  in that language; hello, arithmetic, data types, control flow, advanced functionality, objects, wrappers, libraries etc. etc. . That’s also how I learn natural languages, by relearning the basics of conversation, in that language; hello, how are you I’m well, please thank you you’re welcome I’m sorry excuse me, yes I would like some bread and cheese may i have a large coffee etc. etc.
I expect it will improve as they add more content to the course.

Yeah I hope they add a lot more content. They probably will, 'cos they’ll want to start offering it as an intensive that’s where the real money’s at.

hey bluemanning18,
we are working on it! 3rd module going live this monday  and 4th module the following monday. and then the real fun stuff starts after New Years 

Its short right now, but more is going to be released 

I have just started the C++ course myself, and love it so far. When I have finished, I will tell you my opinion over the whole course.

hey @cpluspluscoder more content coming next week and next next week!

Yay! What about the week after that? Will there be something also. You said

we are working on it! 3rd module going live this monday  and 4th module the following monday. and then the real fun stuff starts after New Years 

So what about that two weeks the 23 and 30th? Will there something planned there too?

not on 23rd and 30th (it’s the holidays). but more in january/february!

Okay! That sounds good! I can’t wait to get the new info!

Ok. I can see why not there, but I can’t wait for the update tommorow!

I’m glad this is here. Not a big C-family person myself, but knowing this is an important programming language, there is a big need for this. Thank you.

Yea, I’m not much of a C++ person either. But the course is great, and like you said, is important to know if you want to get a job in the coding field.

Its actually one of them you need because its an all-purpose language, and used in game creation which makes money.

For one, it doesn’t tell you how to properly declare the functions in the .hpp file, but after I looked it up, and included the .hpp file in the main file, the console still gives an “out of scope” error. Even with the error though, the lesson lets you continue which I believe is also a bug.

•	Marks for basic vehicle checking by the candidate (0-20)
•	Marks for handling the vehicle by the candidate (0-50)
•	Marks for handling traffic situation by the candidate (0-30)
The solution needs to add up the marks of three categories and decide whether the student has passed or failed the driving test. Passing marks are 70 or above.
If the marks are in the range of the category, the program should display the marks. On the other hand, if the marks entered by the user are not in the given range of the category, the user will be informed and will be prompted to enter the valid marks unless the entered marks are in the range. (Hint use while loop to get the input until the value comes in the range).

I  am trying to follow along with the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxHLErBLgI8&feature=youtu.be) on installing and setting up MinGW, but I have Windows 8. The video shows the user going to edit environment variables, selecting “Path” under user variables to edit, that opens a new path window, then selecting “new” and there’s just one line to fill with the new path.
When I click “edit” it only gives me the option of editing the current path. If I click “new” it pops up with a little box that has a line for “variable name” and a line for “variable value.” Do I enter “Path” for variable name and “\MinGW\bin” for variable value?

The video edits PATH, it doesn’t add a new variable, I assume (not a windows user) that gui splits the variable up when displaying it.
For example my path currently looks like this:

And I imagine yours looks similar. Probably a lot shorter, and windows might use a different character to separate the entries.

Are you guys going to make a course that teaches C++
","
The tools are in place, other courses already make use of ubuntu instances so it’d just be compile and run. A matter of writing the course.
No clue what staff’s thoughts are on this, perhaps it’s been said somewhere and I should know.
Regardless, what I really want to say is, that because there isn’t presently such a course, I wouldn’t wait for it to happen.
If you want to learn c++, I suggest checking out these topics in approximately this order (bottom half is arbitrary):
hello-world, how to compile and run
assignment/varibles
types (int string double covers most basic needs)
math and boolean operators
++ and –
*= += etc
if-statements
ternary
for-loops
while-loops
cin and cout
arrays
vectors
for-each (C++11 and later)
sets, maps
bit-wise operators
file i/o
including headers and files
pointers
references
cstrings
casting
classes
templates?
Or, you know, find a tutorial where they actually thought things through rather than just listing topics from the top of their head. Don’t go for those huge books, get a brief overview. Googling the topics above for example.
For practice I suggest checking out some online judges like UVa or SPOJ … there are others - and do the really easy ones. Google a lot.

Is there any certain website you would suggest. I’ve been around the net looking for a good C++ course, but none I’ve found were well made.

I think watching lectures on youtube is a really good way to do it.
Here’s one
It seems to assume knowledge with other languages, and I definitely don’t think C++ is an appropriate first language anyway, better to approach it when you already know how most things are supposed to work in programming and really only need to learn how C++ differs from other languages.
What learning resource is appropriate for a particular person is hugely dependent on that person. Somebody might need 40 hours for something that another will run through in 30 minutes.
So for example Java or C#, they keep you safe by limiting what you can do, much more sane to start with and because they run in virtual machines, you get much much better error messages.
C would also be a decent language to learn before C++, it’s a subset and you can compile C code with the C++ compiler. However, C is a simple language, very few features. C will still let you shoot yourself in the foot, its advantage is that you’re working very close to the computer. It’s not the easy way to learn to program.
Otherwise… Read one of those huge books.
Or take your own path by googling what I wrote above and see where that takes you.
Or learn the absolute basics from any tutorial and then start writing things, a project or solve online judge problems
The fastest way to get into it is to just learn the basics (first 12 things in my list above) and then start writing. Use google as a crutch, use google no matter what really, that’s the number one resource for learning to program.

I’ve found a great textbook called, “Starting Out with C++ from Control Structures to Objects” that you can buy for under $10 on Amazon.

Learn by a youtube viedo. Thats probably always the best way to do it, unless you have a mentor whitch is even more better!

There is a C++ Course!

 teraplayer92635:

there are no such plans.



 teraplayer92635:

as I would really love to learn a low level language.


codecademy is by far not the only learning platform to teach programming languages. Surely there must be other options if you really want to learn something that codecademy doesn’t offer

There are no other sites like Codecademy that has interactive learning experience. There is Khan Academy but that also doesn’t teach C++ 
May I ask why doesn’t CodeCadmey at all plans to have something like C++ or even Rust perhaps as that is a modern language and has higher level abstractions while the langauge itself is a low level programming language?




 teraplayer92635:

There are no other sites like Codecademy that has interactive learning experience


the interactive learning allows spoonfeeding, which might be easy to get started, but if you want to learn one of the most complicated programming languages used today (c++), that won’t do. C++ is very difficult, and it requires a lot of work, hard work, which isn’t achieved with spoonfeeding like codecademy does



 teraplayer92635:

May I ask why doesn’t CodeCadmey at all plans to have something like C++ or even Rust perhaps as that is a modern language and has higher level abstractions while the langauge itself is a low level programming language?


Codecademy mostly focuses on web development, the only exception to this is Java, but java make sense because its used a lot within different segments of the industry, including some back-end web development (spring)
c++ and rust do totally not fit within the direction codecademy is teaching (web development).
c++ is used a lot within the gaming industry, but outside of that, not that much




 stetim94:

that won’t do. C++ is very difficult, and it requires a lot of work, hard work, which isn’t achieved with spoonfeeding like codecademy does


You are right in the sense that spoon feeding is a terrible way to learn if you are not forced to think on your own. However I know that CodeCademy teaches you stuff and then you are forced to think on your own via questions it asks. Take for instance Python for example I remember I did that course with my other account and yeah I remember there were a lot of stuff I had to do by my own eventually. I am sure CodeCademy can do the same for C/C++ and/or Rust.
There is also web assembly Rust which is also web development. So as a suggestion at least have two courses, one that teaches Rust from beginner to absolute advanced and then have another course that teaches WEbassebly Rust.
Do you know by any chance if there is another interactive site like CodeCademy that teaches either C, C++ or Rust?




 teraplayer92635:

However I know that CodeCademy teaches you stuff and then you are forced to think on your own via questions it asks.


its still spoonfeeding, everything is already broken down into small steps for you.



 teraplayer92635:

no, if it exists surely you can find it on google



 teraplayer92635:

codecademy can’t teach everything, i mean there are plenty of languages (php, golang) and frameworks (vueJS) which are web related and are not featured on codecademy

As you can check at Course Poll topic, C++ is the top most requested programming language at Codecademy. However, as @stetim94 stated, the language itself is very complex to be teach using spoon feeding because requires a compiler, know a lot about variable types, how it deals with the microprocessor if used for prototyping and so on.
I am sure there are free and premium courses at other learning platforms, which couldn’t be interactive as CC does but will teach you the basis to learn C++ or Rust. If I am not wrong, Rust website has his own online compiler and tutorials in order to get started within.
I could suggest trying CodeWars or CodeRanks if you want to keep practicing the language from the basis to most sharp edge cutting topics

Few suggestions so far :

There should be a explanation about the meaning of the C++ compiler commands like g++ or the name of the default file a.out (Which means Assembly Output). The same goes for the std command which is related to the standard library of C++ (if I recall correctly).
Atleast move them to the first module for the last one.
Explain why sometimes there is a return 0 line inside the main function 

At the last exercise at the module 2, there is a typo of the Latex: bmi = \frac{weight}{height^2}





 kingdarboja:

Explain why sometimes there is a return 0 line inside the main function


It was explained that this is the way we tell that the function carried out to completion. Is that a little bit vague, by your estimation?
As to how much is explained in any one lesson, that can be shunted off to articles. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel or redocument anything, just grease the wheel, so to speak with narrative and links that lead to answers to these more under-the-skin type of questions.
Least of all, whatever is learned in the presentation of this course should be ported back to the JS, Python, Ruby and Java courses. Presentation is everything and any insight that can be shared with derivative language learners should find its way into the syllabus.

I had to take a look again at the current course chapters and didn’t find anything like that. Perhaps it is just a decorator for the user? Just curious since the main function can work without it 
About the other topic, maybe I am too used to explain to people the most tiny thing of the code instead of letting them think or search on their own. I will take it as an advice rather than an opinion.
Cheers!
