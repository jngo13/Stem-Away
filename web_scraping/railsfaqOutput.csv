Does anyone know how to get the iteration to work? I think my syntax is right, but not sure… don’t we use <% %> ?

Used this in an actual ERB setup and it worked… not sure what the exercise is wanting us to do…
<% @tags.each do |title, image| %>
     <div class=""card col-xs-4"">
         <%= image %>
         <h2> <%= title %> </h2>
    </div>
<% end %>


What in the world are we supposed to do in step 4?

This worked for me

<% @tags.each do |tag| %>



<%= tag.image %>
<%= tag.title %>



<% end %>


Oddly enough, the solution has a todo comment where this code is supposed to be. Huh. I just looked back at the previous project’s HMTL index to see an example.

 <%= @tags.each do |t| %>
      <div class=""card col-xs-4"">
        <%= image_tag(t.image) %>
        <h2> <%= t.title %> </h2>
      </div>
      <% end %>

This one worked fine


> <% @tags.each do |t| %>
>       <div class=""card col-xs-4""> 
>         <%= image_tag( t.image ) %>
>         <h2> <%= t.title %> </h2>
>       </div>
>  <% end %>


> Do not add the equal sign while performing iteration. = means echo

Is that not what we want it to do? echo prints the content to the element it is embedded in. The object is to generate well formed markup around all the scoped data, hence the template.

if we use echo while performing the iteration. It prints the seed from the database.

Not sure I follow. tags is the scoped data array that is being iterated over as I see it. How else do we write it into the template? (‘echo’ is your word, but also a PHP keyword that performs similarly the same task.)
echo ""<p><img src=\""$t.image\""><br>$t.title</p>"";

The above is pseudo code. Don’t try to run it.

What I mean by echo is! The = sign after % in the iterator, output (copies) and display what is there in the database. Hope you understand!

One difference in our perspective is I don’t see the data as a database, but a data table, or more particularly, a data array. An index view doesn’t query the data; it polls the data via iteration.

If we seed the database. To be more precise = equal sign means I want the results to be displayed.   Hope this gives you clear idea.




 dev_sreeram:

Do not add the equal sign while performing iteration.


Which brings us back to this. It contradicts what this is saying,



 dev_sreeram:

I want the results to be displayed
